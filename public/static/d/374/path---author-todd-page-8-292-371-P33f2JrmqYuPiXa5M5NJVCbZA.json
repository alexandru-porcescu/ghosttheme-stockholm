We wanted to tell the world, and that we did. A lot. Yet here I\nam, about to helplessly sing cliche praises one more time. \n\nI’m a prisoner of circumstance here. As it turns out, the vast (and I mean vast)\nmajority of our fans have a raging Pandas addiction. They come to our humble\nmom-and-pop shop here at Hackers and Slackers foaming at the mouth, going on\nraging benders for all Pandas-related content. If I had half a brain, I’d rename\nthis site Pandas and Pandas  and delete all non-Pandas-related content. Talk\nabout cash money. \n\nAs a middle-ground, I’ve decided to do a bit of housekeeping. My previous “Intro\nto Pandas” post was an unflattering belligerent mess jotted into a Confluence\ninstance long ago during a Friday night  pregame. That mess snuck its way on to\nthis blog, and has gone unnoticed for a year now. I've decided that this\nprobably wasn't the best way to open up a series about the most influential\nPython library of all time. We're going to try this again... For the Pandas.\n\nIntro to Pandas Rereleased: in IMAX 8k 4D \nPandas is used to analyze and modify tabular data in Python. When we say\n“tabular data,” we mean any instance in life where data is represented in a\ntable format. Excel, SQL databases, shitty HTML tables.... they’ve all been the\nsame thing with different syntax this whole time. Pandas can achieve anything\nthat any other table can. \n\nIf you’re reasonably green to data analysis and are experiencing the \n“oh-my-God-all-data-professions-are-kinda-just-Excel”  realization as we speak,\nfeel free to take a moment. Great, that’s behind us now.\n\nThe Anatomy of a DataFrame\nTabular data in Pandas is referred to as a “DataFrame.” We can’t call everything \n “tables-” otherwise, our choice of vague terminology would grow horribly\nconfusing when we refer to data in different systems. Between you and me though,\nDataFrames are basically tables.\n\nSo how do we represent two-dimensional data via command line: a concept which\ninherently interprets and displays information one-dimensionally? \n\n\"Oh nothing, we think it's cute.\"DataFrames consist of individual parts which\nare easy-to-understand at face value. It’s the complexity of these things\ntogether, creating a sum greater than the whole of its parts, which fuels the\nseemingly endless power of DataFrames. If we want any  hope of contributing to\nthe field of Data Science, we need to not only understand the terminology but at\nleast be aware of core concepts of what a DataFrame is beneath the hood. This\nunderstanding is what separates engineers from Excel monkeys. \n\nEngineers\n1\nWinExcel Nerds\n0\nLoseParts of a DataFrame\nWere you expecting this post just to be a bunch of one-liners in Pandas? Good, I\nhope you're disappointed. Strap yourself in, we might actually learn something\ntoday. Class is now in session, baby. Let's break apart what makes a DataFrame,\npiece-by-piece:\n\nThe most basic description of any table would be a collection of columns and \nrows. Despite looking at a two-dimensional grid, columns are in fact very\ndifferent from rows. Unlike rows, all data in a column  typically abides by the\nsame data type. In the above example, any value saved in the startTime  column\nwill always be a time. Rows, on the other hand, are simply an entry- an instance\nof a \"thing\", where each thing is described by attributes stored horizontally\nacross columns.\n\nThis seems like really elementary stuff, but I mention it for a reason. By our\ndefinition, columns  are more pivotal to structuring a table than rows, because\neven empty columns have meaning, whereas an empty row with no columns will\nalways equal infinite nothingness. Rows are made up of values in columns, not\nthe other way around. Thus, columns in Pandas are actually their own type of\nobject called a Series. \n\n * Series' are objects native to Pandas (and Numpy) which refer to\n   one-dimensional sequences of data. Another example of a one-dimensional\n   sequence of data could be an array, but series' are much more than arrays:\n   they're a class of their own for many powerful reasons, which we'll see in a\n   moment.\n * Axis  refers to the 'direction' of a series, or in other words \"column\" or\n   \"row\". A series with an axis of 0  is a row, whereas a series with an axis of\n    1  is a column. \n * A series contains labels, which are given visual names for a row/column\n   specifying labels allows us to call upon any labeled series in the same way\n   we would access a value in a Python dictionary. For instance, accessing \n   dataframe['awayTeamName']  returns the entire column matching the header \n   \"awayTeamName\".\n * Every row and column has a numerical index. Most of the time, a row's label \n   will be equivalent to the row's index. While it's common practice to define\n   headers for columns, columns have indexes as well, which simply aren't shown.\n   In this regard, Series share an attribute with lists/arrays, in that they are\n   a collection of indexed values\n\nConsider the last two points: we just described a series to work the same way as\na Python dictionary, but also the same way as a Python list. That's right:\nseries' objects are like the biracial offspring of lists and dicts. We can\naccess any column by either its name or its index, and the same goes for rows.\nEven if we rip a column out from a DataFrame, each cell in that series will\nstill retain the row labels for every cell. This means we can say things like \nget me column #3, and then find me the value for whatever was in the row labeled\n\"Y\".  Of course, this works in the reverse as well. It's crazy how things get\nexponentially more powerful and complicated when we add entire dimensions, isn't\nit?\n\nLoading Data Into Pandas\nIf you've made it this far, you've earned the right to start getting hands-on.\nLuckily, Pandas has plenty of methods to load tabular data into DataFrames,\nregardless if you're using static files, SQL, or quirkier methods, Pandas has\nyou covered. Here are some of my favorite examples:\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Reads a local CSV file.\ncsv_df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n\n# Similar to above\nexcel_df = pd.read_excel('data.xlsx')\n\n# Creating tabular data from non-tabular JSON\njson_df = pd.read_json('data.json')\n\n# Direct db access utilizing SQLAlchemy\nread_sql = read_sql('SELECT * FROM blah', conn=sqlalchemy_engine)\n\n# My personal ridiculous favorite: HTML table to DataFrame.\nread_html = read_html('examplePageWithTable.html')\n\n# The strength of Google BigQuery: already officially supported by Pandas\nread_gbq = read_gbq('SELECT * FROM test_dataset.test_table', projectid)\n\n\nAll of these achieve the same result of creating a DataFrame. No matter what\nhorrible data sources you may have been forced to inherit, Pandas is here to\nhelp. Pandas knows our pain. Pandas is love. Pandas is life.\n\nWith data loaded, let's see how we can apply our new knowledge of series'  to\ninteract with out data.\n\nFinding Data in Our Dataframe\nPandas has a method for finding a series by label, as well as a separate method\nfor finding a series by index. These methods are .iloc  and .loc, respectively.\nLet's say our DataFrame from the example above is stored as a variable named \nbaseball_df. To get the values of a column by name, we would do the following:\n\nbaseball_df = baseball_df.iloc['homeTeamName']\nprint(baseball_df)\n\n\nThis would return the following:\n\n0   Cubs\n1   Indians\n2   Padres\n3   Diamondbacks\n4   Giants\n5   Blue Jays\n6   Reds\n7   Cubs\n8   Rockies\n9   Yankees\nName: homeTeamName, dtype: object\n\n\nThat's our column! We can see the row labels being listed alongside each row's\nvalue. Told ya so. Getting a column will also return the column's dtype, or data\ntype. Data types can be set on columns explicitly. If they aren't, Pandas will\ngenerally either default to detecting that the data in the column is a float \n(returned for any column which only holds numerical values, despite number of\ndecimal points) or an 'object', which is a fancy catch-all meaning \"fuck if I\nknow, there's letters and shit in there, it could be anything probably.\" Pandas\ndoesn't try hard on its own to discern the types of data in each field.\n\nIf you're thinking ahead, you might see a looming conflict of interest with iloc\n. Since we've established that columns and rows are the same, and we're\naccessing series' based on criteria that is met by both  columns and rows (every\ntable has a first row and a first column), how does Pandas know what we want\nwith .loc()? Short answer: It doesn't, so it just returns both! \n\nbaseball_df = baseball_df.loc[3]\nprint(baseball_df)\n\n\n    homeTeamName    awayTeamName   startTime      duration_minutes\n0   Cubs            Reds           18:20:00 UTC   188\n1   Indians         Astros         18:20:00 UTC   194\n2   Padres          Giants         18:20:00 UTC   185\n3   Diamondbacks    Brewers        18:20:00 UTC   211\n\n\nAhhh, a 4x4 grid! This does, in fact, satisfy what we asked for- albiet in a\nclever, intentional way. \"Clever and intentional\"  is actually a great way to\ndescribe Pandas as a library. This combination of ease and power is what makes\nPandas so magnetic to curious newcomers. \n\nWant another example? How about leveraging the unique attributes of series'  to\nsplice DataFrames as though they were arrays?\n\nsliced_df = df.loc['homeTeamName':'awayTeamName']\nprint(sliced_df)\n\n\n    homeTeamName    awayTeamName\n0   Cubs            Reds        \n1   Indians         Astros      \n2   Padres          Giants      \n3   Diamondbacks    Brewers     \n\n\n...Did we just do that? We totally did. We were able to slice a two-dimensional\nset of data by using the same syntax that we'd used to slice arrays, thanks to\nthe power of the series object.\n\nWelcome to the Club\nThere are a lot more entertaining, mind-blowing ways to introduce people to\nPandas. If our goal had been sheer amusement, we would have leveraged the\ncookie-cutter route to Pandas tutorials: overloading readers with Pandas\n\"tricks\" displaying immense power in minimal effort. Unfortunately, we took the\napplicable approach to actually retaining information. Surely this model of\n\"informational and time consuming\" will beat out \"useless but instantly\ngratifying,\" right? RIGHT? \n\nWhatever. I’ll schedule the Pandas and Pandas rebrand for next week. From now on\nwhen people want that quick fix, you can call me Pablo Escobar. Join us next\ntime when we use Pandas data analysis to determine which private Caribbean\nisland offers the best return on investment with all the filthy money we’ll\nmake.\n\nHint: it’s definitely not the Fyre festival one.","html":"<p>Let’s face it: the last thing the world needs is another “<strong>Intro to Pandas</strong>” post.
