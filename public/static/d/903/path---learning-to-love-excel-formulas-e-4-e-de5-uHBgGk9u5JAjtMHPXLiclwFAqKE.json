The\nanswer lies in the utilization of wild combinations of Formulae to achieve\nresults that the program was never designed to give.\n\nFor the extremely green among you, an Excel formula is essentially text that\nenters a cell that asks Excel to do some form of calculation.

There are only maybe a handful of formulae worth using, and\n 2. Its way quicker (as well as more impressive to the less informed) to write\n    them in yourself.\n\nEach formula is comprised of the following parts:\n\n 1. The Command  which is the phrase immediately after the \"=\" which is what\n    tells Excel to do that thing.\n 2. An open parenthesis immediately after the command\n 3. One or more variables  which is what you're telling Excel to calculate with\n    (one hot tip  is that you can always tell what kind of variables you need as\n    well as how many by simply typing in the command you're looking to use).\n 4. A closed parenthesis (which is always how formulae should end).\n\nReading this, you may say \"so what, isn't who whole point of this blog to stop\nusing Excel as an overpriced (although still cheaper than a TI-89+) calculator?\"\nWhile this is a very valid question, please allow me to blow your mind  and\nremind you that anything you see on a computer is really just a combination of\n1s and 0s, and you can change those 1s and 0s into whatever you damn well\nplease...so long as you know how to ask. In other words, essentially anything\nyou see in Excel can be both calculated with or on by almost anything else, you\njust need to get creative.\n\nNow that this primer is done, let's try your newly acquired skills using the\nmost rudimentary Excel functions: =SUM. Don't fret about this small piece of\nhomework as once you have a basic grasp of how to write a formula, then we can\nstart to get really weird.\n\nHeres a small set of Data to paste into Excel:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n6\n7\n9\n\n\nNow try clicking on an empty cell to the right of any of the numbers and typing\nin =SUM(.
