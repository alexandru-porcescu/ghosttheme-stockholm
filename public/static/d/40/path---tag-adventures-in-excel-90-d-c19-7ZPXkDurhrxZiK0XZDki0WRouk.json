What is this you ask? it's a pretty standard\ncomputer programming function (up there with the IF statement and the OR\nstatement) that does a particular thing FOR a certain period of time in which a\nparticular condition is true (like for instance, as long as the person's name\nremains the same. Granted, you can do FOR loops in VBA, but it's not as easy as\nit should be, and we'd probably have to do most of the same steps in order to\nget the full benefit. \n\nHowever, this isn't standard programming...THIS IS EXCEL! As such, we needed to\nget creative, and approximate the FOR loop without using VBA. Here's what we had\nto work with: \n\n * A list of names (in this case, it'll be column A) \n * A unique ID for each of the people on the list (This will be Column B)\n * An issue (in this case, a diagnosis) that each person had, and each line has\n   a different issue, even if it's the same person. (Column C)\n * A bunch of other information that isn't important for this trick. (Who\n   cares?)\n\nHere's how we go about doing it: \n\n 1. Sort the entire list by the ID, that way, the data for the same people are\n    all next to each other. \n 2. Create two new columns, one that does the heavy lifting, and one that\n    signifies (or \"Flags) that Excel should stop iterating. \n 3. In the first of the two created columns (let's put a heading on it called\n    \"combined\") put in the following formula starting with cell D2 and populate\n    your whole column:\n    =IF(B1=B2,CONCATENATE(D1, \";\",C2),C2)\n\n\t\tWhat this is doing is checking to see if the two IDs match (and thus are the\nsame people) and it builds a string combining all of the issues every time\nthere's a match. In the end, column D is going to be the column where the \"work\"\nis done. Of note, the \";\" added in the middle is for aesthetics, feel free to\nignore it, or just plug in some other type of spacer.\n\n\t4. In the second of the created columns (let's call this one \"flag) put in the\nfollowing formula: =IF(B2=B3,\"\",1)\n\n\tThis basically adds a 1 (or whatever you decide to write in) on the last line\nof each loop, signifying that Excel should start the process over on the next\nline instead of continuing to build the string. you start on the cell below the\ninitial cell so that you don't accidentally put the flag on the first line (as\nthe heading and the name is never going to match) This leads us to the final\nstep:\n\n\t5. Filter the sheet by the \"flag\" column for 1, and if so desired, copy and\npaste this filtered list into a new sheet.\n\nThis final step allows you to hide all rows that aren't the final row in the\nloop, thus giving you only 1 line per person with the combined issues that the\nperson had! See below for the finished product.\n\nRemember, the flag column has the following formula =IF(b2=b3,\"\",1)So there you\ngo, using only 2 columns and as many formulas you can easily inject a loop into\nExcel! This technique has many uses, as you may want to continue running a\nformula down a column until a certain \"thing\" happens elsewhere on the\nsheet...the possibilities are endless! \n\nSo today, we've learned the following:\n\n 1. What iterators and FOR loops do in computer programming.\n 2. How to create and utilize an iterator to complete any task that needs to\n    continue running until a particular goal is reached.\n\nNext time, I think we'll probably delve back into Active X and Form controls, so\nthat you can improve the life of your less savvy co-workers, and make yourself\nlook like a boss in the meantime.\n\nSigning off,\n\n-Snacks","html":"<p>Hi there dear reader, so, I know that in the previous article that I penned, I stated that I'd be showing you how to create buttons that you can interact with (and I know you know that because you're reading these in order...right?) but I recently had to create something that was so cool, I had to write about it (once you've drank enough data Kool-Aid, you too will find solutions to data manipulation problems cool).</p><p>Here's the scene: we've got a list of people, each with a particular issue, however, due to why I needed to put the data together, we needed to combine all of the issues that each person had in a single cell for the person they were associated with. </p><p>Now, if this were <em>regular </em>computer programming, the solution would be simple: create an iterative FOR loop.

Can't use macros because the end user doesn't know what a macro is.\n2. Need to have built in constraints because \"it just needs to be there to work\"\nis literally begging someone to mess up a perfectly good formula.\n3.

Can't utilize your own macros because the end user isn't going to have access\nto them, and finally... \n5. You can no longer say things like \"pivot out\", \"lookup\", or \"index\" and\ninstead need to break each of those things down into a series of button clicks\n(hence why the documentation becomes 16 pages).\n\nWith that being said, let's jump into one of the easiest ways that you can build\nreports that allow even the unenlightened the ability to touch the sun: using a\nnamed dynamic range and a form control to auto-populate and refresh a pivot\ntable.\n\nNow, if any of those words are unfamiliar to you, you need to go back to the\nbeginning of the series (with special attention to the post regarding naming\nranges and active-X controls) so that you know how to do the following:\n\n 1. Build a pivot table\n 2. Name a range\n\nIf you've got the tricks in the bag, let's get going. In order to get this trick\nto work the first step is building a named dynamic range. This is a glorious\ntrick that takes the convenience of naming a range (being able to grab that\ninformation from anywhere in a workbook) along with the UNLIMITED POWER of\nassociating anything that someone may plug into the range with the name. \n\nFirst, let's start with a sample data-set of super heroes and their secret\nidentities, like so (you'll need developer active for this to work): \n\nMiles Morales and Amadeus Cho notwithstandingSo, now's where the magic happens:\nclick formulas-->Name Manager\n\nNote the dialogue box.In the resulting dialog box, click \"new\":\n\nSeen here: how these become 16 page tutorialsIn the resulting dialog box, name\nthe range whatever you want (just remember...no spaces), but the magic really\nhappens at the bottom where it says \"refers to\", as shown here: \n\nPictured here: what the coolest thing looks like before it happensNow, in that\nbox, you'll notice that you can put in a formula, and this one is KEY to\nremember both for this, and anytime you want to make a dynamic range in the\nfuture, and it is: \n=OFFSET(Sheet1!$A$1,0,0,COUNTA(Sheet1!$A:$A),COUNTA(Sheet1!$1:$1))\n* substitute the name of your worksheet for sheet1. \nEssentially, OFFSET  is how you set your imaginary cursor (remember, you CAN\ntechnically do everything you see in Excel from a command line, and this is how\nit knows where you are). It requires 3-5 variables: \n\n * The first (the reference) is what you want your \"mouse\" to select before it\n   finds it's way elsewhere.\n * The second and third is the number of rows and columns you want to move in\n   order to select your next item. You can end here, but you'd just wind up\n   moving your \"cursor\" to another cell. Instead, we set this to zero for both\n   because you don't want to move anywhere. \n * The 4th is the hight (in cells) of what you're selecting (that way, you can\n   select any number of cells vertically from where your cursor wound up) and we\n   use \"COUNTA\" here to mean the number of cells that aren't blank in column A.\n * The 5th and final variable is the width which serves the same function as\n   height in the other direction. By using \"COUNTA\" here, we're selecting the\n   number of columns that aren't blank in row 1.\n\nIf you did everything right, you should end up like this: \n\nNow you can officially claim to be \"Dynamic\" on your resumeIf you're thinking\nwith portals, you may have already pieced together what we've done here: by\nnaming the range, we can substitute any variable that'll support an array with\nthe name of the range, AND by using that offset formula, we've just made it so\nthat no matter what you throw into this first sheet, it gets added to the range.\n \n\nThis by itself is very cool, and very useful, but let's take it a step further\nand I'll show you how you can use this dynamic named range to make an \"idiot\nproof\" updater for a pivot table. \n\nThe first step is to of course make a pivot table, however, we're going to do\nsomething daring: a pivot table requires an array...and we've just created an\narray that's DYNAMIC. So, click insert, pivot table, and then when it asks you\nwhat you what you want in the table, tell it that you want to put powers in\nthere (that's the name of my range) like so:\n\nNo one man should have all this power...and boom:\n\nNot for VillainsBUT IT DOESN'T END THERE FOLKS. As your range is dynamic, you\ncan add whatever rows or columns to the first page as you wish, and then if you\nrefresh your pivot table (right click, refresh) these changes will be\nreflected...watch\n\nSpecifically for VillainsIT'S DYNAMIC!So, now you've learned how to:\n\n * Create a named dynamic range\n * Use the offset function to set a virtual cursor (this becomes exceedingly\n   important if ever you decide you want to code for real).\n * Refresh a pivot table with information updated in the dynamic range. \n\nNext time, we'll take it up a notch, and remove any sort of thought needed to\nupdate these tables! \n\nIt's Munchin' Time, \n\n-Snacks","html":"<p>First things first, 10 points to anyone who understands what the title is referring to (that's either Charles Atlas' workout philosophy, or one of core tenants of Bokononism in Kurt Vonnegut's standout <em>Cat's Cradle). </em></p><p>Now, with my obscure reference quota filled for the day, let's assume that you've been working as an analyst for some time now.

In order to get this trick to work the first step is building a <strong>named dynamic range. </strong>This is a glorious trick that takes the convenience of naming a range (being able to grab that information from anywhere in a workbook) along with the <em>UNLIMITED POWER </em>of associating anything that someone may plug into the range with the name. </p><p>First, let's start with a sample data-set of super heroes and their secret identities, like so (you'll need developer active for this to work): </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-2.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/image-7.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Miles Morales and Amadeus Cho notwithstanding</figcaption></figure><p>So, now's where the magic happens: click formulas--&gt;Name Manager</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/image-8.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Note the dialogue box.</figcaption></figure><p>In the resulting dialog box, click \"new\":</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/image-9.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Seen here: how these become 16 page tutorials</figcaption></figure><p>In the resulting dialog box, name the range whatever you want (just remember...no spaces), but the magic really happens at the bottom where it says \"refers to\", as shown here: </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/image-10.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Pictured here: what the coolest thing looks like before it happens</figcaption></figure><p>Now, in that box, you'll notice that you can put in a formula, and this one is KEY to remember both for this, and anytime you want to make a dynamic range in the future, and it is: <code>=OFFSET(Sheet1!$A$1,0,0,COUNTA(Sheet1!$A:$A),COUNTA(Sheet1!$1:$1))</code><br>* substitute the name of your worksheet for sheet1. <br>Essentially, <strong>OFFSET</strong> is how you set your imaginary cursor (remember, you CAN technically do everything you <em>see </em>in Excel from a command line, and this is how it knows where you are). It requires 3-5 variables: </p><ul><li>The first (the reference) is what you want your \"mouse\" to select before it finds it's way elsewhere.</li><li>The second and third is the number of rows and columns you want to move in order to select your next item. You can end here, but you'd just wind up moving your \"cursor\" to another cell. Instead, we set this to zero for both because you don't want to <em>move </em>anywhere. </li><li>The 4th is the hight (in cells) of what you're selecting (that way, you can select any number of cells vertically from where your cursor wound up) and we use \"COUNTA\" here to mean the number of cells that aren't blank in column A.</li><li>The 5th and final variable is the width which serves the same function as height in the other direction. By using \"COUNTA\" here, we're selecting the number of columns that aren't blank in row 1.</li></ul><p>If you did everything right, you should end up like this: </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/image-11.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Now you can officially claim to be \"Dynamic\" on your resume</figcaption></figure><p>If you're thinking with portals, you may have already pieced together what we've done here: by naming the range, we can substitute any variable that'll support an array with the name of the range, AND by using that offset formula, we've just made it so that no matter what you throw into this first sheet, it gets added to the range. </p><p>This by itself is very cool, and very useful, but let's take it a step further and I'll show you how you can use this dynamic named range to make an \"idiot proof\" updater for a pivot table. </p><p>The first step is to of course make a pivot table, however, we're going to do something daring: a pivot table requires an array...and we've just created an array that's DYNAMIC. So, click insert, pivot table, and then when it asks you what you what you want in the table, tell it that you want to put powers in there (that's the name of my range) like so:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/image-12.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>No one man should have all this power...</figcaption></figure><p>and boom:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/image-13.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Not for Villains</figcaption></figure><p>BUT IT DOESN'T END THERE FOLKS. As your range is dynamic, you can add whatever rows or columns to the first page as you wish, and then if you refresh your pivot table (right click, refresh) these changes will be reflected...watch</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/image-14.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Specifically for Villains</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/image-15.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-5.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/image-16.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>IT'S DYNAMIC!</figcaption></figure><p>So, now you've learned how to:</p><ul><li>Create a named dynamic range</li><li>Use the offset function to set a virtual cursor (this becomes exceedingly important if ever you decide you want to code for real).</li><li>Refresh a pivot table with information updated in the dynamic range. </li></ul><p>Next time, we'll take it up a notch, and remove any sort of thought needed to update these tables! </p><p>It's Munchin' Time, </p><p>-Snacks</p>","url":"https://hackersandslackers.com/dynamic-named-ranges-in-excel/","uuid":"b7ef3b91-ecfd-42ab-8288-d2de7d4ceb32","page":false,"codeinjection_foot":"","codeinjection_head":"","comment_id":"5b885ae7075b34075786e311"}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c12d7bfe875ad7bb86736cb","title":"Active-X Gonna Give it to Ya","slug":"excel-named-ranges-and-the-active-xs-who-love-them","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://hackersandslackers.com/content/images/2018/08/dmx@2x.jpg","excerpt":"Excel Named Ranges and the Active Xs who Love Them.","custom_excerpt":"Excel Named Ranges and the Active Xs who Love Them.","created_at_pretty":"10 August, 2018","published_at_pretty":"10 August, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"02 February, 2019","created_at":"2018-08-10T11:25:48.000-04:00","published_at":"2018-08-10T14:19:22.000-04:00","updated_at":"2019-02-02T03:46:01.000-05:00","meta_title":"Excel Named Ranges and Active Xs | Hackers and Slackers","meta_description":"Excel offers the ability to \"name\" a particular range (or \"collection of cells\").

For those just joining us, these tools are as\nfollows: \n\n * Pivot Tables (both the report layout and the tabular layout)\n * Lookup Functions\n * IF + AND + OR statements \n * And the combination of these three tools (and if you're particularly\n   efficient, you may have dabbled in some VBA here and there)\n\nHowever, if you have functioning vision (and once you've generated 10,000 hours\nworth of pivot tables and lookups...you may not need to see anymore), you may\nnotice that Excel has about 20,000 more buttons that you've never interacted\nwith! Any reasonable individual would assume that you must be missing\nsomething...but we're not reasonable...we're ANALYSTS. \n\nTo solve this puzzle, I ask you to think back to our discussion on databases,\nand how they quickly grow unwieldy: deleting code will often cause significantly\nmore problems than just leaving the code in there and hoping no one wants to use\nit (have you ever glitched through a wall while playing a video-game only to see\na half designed level...that's something that the dev team didn't have time to\nfinish!)\n\nOne thing to remember is that the proto-version of Excel was one of the very\nfirst programs available on the personal computer (that would be VisiCalc for\nthe Apple II if you're the type of person who's into esoteric computer trivia)\nand it revolutionized the world...of accounting. After Windows overtook Apple in\nthe PC department, Excel soon followed, and because it was the only game in\ntown, it needed to do any calculation related task that the user-base (which at\nthis time didn't include everyone) came up with. \n\nIf you've ever taken a computer programming class, this may sound familiar, in\nthat it's the exact same design methodology as the programming language Java.\nJava was designed so that you could code ANYTHING on it and it would run on ANY\nplatform. However, the downside of this is that with the exception of a small\nset of things that Java does pretty well, coding in Java quickly gets miserable,\nit's slow as molasses, and in case you haven't noticed, your Java applet needs\nto update whenever anyone in the world thinks of a new idea (seriously, check\nthe lower right hand corner of your screen, an update is pending right now!)\n\nSo now that this entertaining history lesson is over, let's leverage a few of\nthose tools that our ancestors left us in order to make our (or more\nimportantly, an end-user's) life easier. \n\nThe first of these functions that I care to talk about is the \"naming of\nranges\". Back in the day, Excel wouldn't let you open up two workbooks at the\nsame time, making it difficult and annoying to lookup between worksheets\n(granted, I'd argue that best practice is that if you're planning on leaving\nthose formulas on your worksheet, that you paste the source data into a new\nworksheet in your workbook or risk the breaking of your links). In order to make\nboth inter and intra worksheet lookups and formulas easier, Excel offers the\nability to \"name\" a particular range (or \"collection of cells\"...the concept of\na range becomes much more important if you're coding VBA). For example, here I\nhave a list of random names: \n\nTotally Random NamesNow, if I were to write a formula that would involve these\nnames (such as finding out where DMX is hiding) I would probably just use the\nlocation of the range (A:A, or $A$2:$A$8 if you're an absolute kinda person).\nHOWEVER, I can also bless this column with a name.   \n\nTo do this, highlight the row or column, click formulas up top, and then go to\n\"Define Name\"\n\nNaming a RangeThe interface automatically takes the first cell and assumes that\nyou want it to be the name of the range (NO SPACES!) but I like to keep things\nto a single word, so let's call this \"Names\", and hit OK. \n\nWhat you've now done is transformed anything in column A on sheet 1 of this\nworkbook into a monolith known as \"Names\". While this sounds unimpressive on\nit's own (what is a name?) it comes in handy in two ways. \n\n1) If you're ever writing a formula that refers to column A, you can now just\ntype \"Names\" instead, no matter what sheet the formula starts in, as long as\nit's in the workbook (which saves you a ton of time, and makes it so that you\ndon't need to click back to sheet 1 to select column A or to type 'Sheet 1!'A:A\nwhich you'll almost certainly screw up (In fact, that's probably wrong). For\nexample, let's create a bunch of extra sheets to complicate things, and then try\nand find DMX. \n\nThe real question is...what IS he going to give you?The utility there is pretty\nevident, however, there's an even more useful reason for naming a range, and it\ninvolves another one of Excel's functions...the active-X controls. Plopping\nthese controls into a workbook allows someone who calls tech support when their\ncomputer crashes to read your data...and as such, represent an important albeit\nun-enjoyable part of the job. \n\nTo drop one of these into your worksheet, first go to developer (which, as a\nperson who's made it this far, I assume you've enabled), then insert (the cool\ninsert, not the one for pleebs), and then active-X control (I generally use the\ncombo box...and no, I don't know what it's a combination of).

If a superior of yours has ever asked you to \"slice\" and or \"dice\" the data \n2. If you're asked to color code things arbitrarily. Then you might be an\nanalyst.\n\nNow, while you're sitting at your desk (in what's most likely an Aeron chair)\nand you read the above qualifiers, the first thought that pops into your mind\nshould be: \"WTF does slice and dice mean when it comes to data analysis?\" The\nanswer may surprise you in that it's not just meaningless business lingo, it's\nactually a pretty good explanation of what you're going to be doing A LOT of\n(but fear not, in all likelihood, your boss didn't mean it like that due to what\nI'd like to call the leveraging of the synergy paradigm).\n\n\nEssentially, when one attempts to slap-chop a \"data dump\" (in the computer\npatois, that's how you say data that's pulled straight from the source), it\noften involves as the first step \"normalizing\" the data so that the format is\nlogical, and is in a position in which you can start employing some of the\nwizardry that we've been speaking about.\nThe normalization process often involves only a few steps, all of which are\nquite easy, but EXTREMELY un-intuitive, and if you follow these steps, you'll\neither be done with the normalization process, or you'll be able to figure out\nhow (all data dumps are dirty, but not all shit is created equal).\n\n1. Ensure that your data has headings!\na. Headings are essential not just because they're a logical way to organize  \n your variables, but they're are also REQUIRED to build a pivot table down the\nroad, if even one of your columns doesn't have a heading, Excel won't play nice!\n \n2. Ensure that your headings don't repeat themselves\na. While this may seem obvious, if a heading repeats itself, Excel won't pivot\nproperly, won't graph correctly AND won't upload properly in external tools\n(such as Microsoft Access, which we'll explore in a later post!) \n3. Ensure that multiple sources are all located on the same Excel workbook\n(basically, if you're pulling data from multiple places, that you paste them all\ninto the same Excel file).\na. Note that since Excel 2007, this step isn't 100% necessary, but it makes\nthings much faster in both ease of use, and in the computational sense. \n4. And finally, ensure that your variables are in the correct format...which is\nwhat we'll focus on for the rest of this post.\n\nOften, data dumps combine multiple variables into one \"string\" (a set of\ncharacters with no other format) most often last names, first names, and ID\nnumbers which is fine when you're trying to figure out how many\nSmith,Bob,8675309s exist in your data...so basically useless on it's own. This\nbrings us to the title of this post: how we're going to slice up (or \"Parse\")\nthis string so that it's useful to us. \n\nThere are a few was of going about this, but in my experience the most useful is\nsome combination of the following formulae:\n=LEFT  which returns a specified number of characters from the start of a\nstring. \n=RIGHT  which returns a specified number of characters from the end of the\nstring. \n=MID   which returns a specified number of characters from a defined point in\nthe string \n=LEN  which returns the number of characters in the string, and \n=FIND  which returns the location of a specified character or string within a\nstring. Just a word to the wise, starting from the beginning is always 0, not 1\nin any of these examples. \n\nAssuming you've got some android in you, you notice that =left  and =right  are\nbasically useless if you need to break up a string (but can be useful if you\nwind up with a data dump that gives you a preset amount of garbage to throw away\neach time, or as a second step in this process). Instead, we're going to\nleverage the fact that Data Dumps are generally exported in Comma Separated\nFormat (CSV) which means that there are going to be a lot of commas for you to\nset as \"flags\" where you want to break things up. Take the example I gave you\nbefore: Smith,Bob,8675309s. \nThis is actually a particularly mean example because you're going to need to\nbreak it into three steps for which there are multiple solutions, simply because\nthere's more than one comma to \"put your flag down\". One way you can go about it\nis as such: \n\nFirst use the \"mid\" function alongside the \"find\" command in order to separate\nthe last name from the first name and ID, like so: \n=MID(A1,FIND(\",\",A1)+1,LEN(A1))\nThe result of this will be Bob,8675309, and the reason why the +1 is included is\nso that we don't include the comma (which would start this whole circus again)\nFrom there, you can repeat the steps on the newly created Bob,8675309 in order\nto obtain the ID.\n\nOnce you have the ID number, if you return to the original string and perform \n=left(A1(find(\",\",A1)-1)  (the -1 removes the first comma as opposed to the\nsecond) you'll get \"Smith\"\n\nFinally, you can go to the Bob,8675309 string (which we'll say is located in B1)\nand perform the same steps in order to get \"Bob\" all by itself. \n\nWith all that being said, until we get a bit more advanced (yes, you can do this\nin fewer steps), assume you need one formula per comma in order to \"parse\" each\nsection, and you'll find your way. The benefit of breaking it down this way is\nthat you can drag the formula down and it'll perform the exact same steps\nregardless of how long the initial string is, as long as it has 3 commas. \n\nSo, what have we learned? \n\n 1.

To put things in perspective, if you've conquered all the quests that I've set you upon, you should now be able to:<br><br>* Open up and add macro code into an Excel Worksheet <br>* Utilize lookup functions (particularly Index(Match)) to compare and validate data sets <br>* Build a complex formula<br>* Utilize IF/AND/and OR statements in order to manipulate data and finally... <br>* Understand your role in the data underground<br><br>If there was any running theme among the posts in the past, it's that if you're in the position in which you're forced to utilize Excel in order to analyze data, you're probably grabbing a dirty version of the data-set from an intermediary platform (such as Tableau or Business Objects) built by a developer who isn't informed as to how the end user is going to use the data. </p><p>Your mission, whether you choose to accept it or not is essentially to take data from people who know data and don't know the business, and turn it into data for people who know business and don't understand numbers.<br>If you're wondering if perhaps you're in this role and don't know it yet, there's a simple two question litmus test</p><p><code>=IF(AND(COLORCODING,OR(SLICE,DICE)),\"Analyst\",\"Something Else\"</code><br><br>For those of you who are just joining the party, that essentially says that if:<br> 1. If a superior of yours has ever asked you to \"slice\" and or \"dice\" the data <br>2. If you're asked to color code things arbitrarily. Then you might be an analyst.<br><br>Now, while you're sitting at your desk (in what's most likely an Aeron chair) and you read the above qualifiers, the first thought that pops into your mind should be: \"WTF does slice and dice mean when it comes to data analysis?\" The answer may surprise you in that it's not just meaningless business lingo, it's actually a pretty good explanation of what you're going to be doing A LOT of (but fear not, in all likelihood, your boss didn't mean it like that due to what I'd like to call the <em><strong>leveraging of the synergy paradigm</strong></em>).</p><p><br>Essentially, when one attempts to slap-chop a \"data dump\" (in the computer patois, that's how you say data that's pulled straight from the source), it often involves as the first step \"normalizing\" the data so that the format is logical, and is in a position in which you can start employing some of the wizardry that we've been speaking about.<br>The normalization process often involves only a few steps, all of which are quite easy, but EXTREMELY un-intuitive, and if you follow these steps, you'll either be done with the normalization process, or you'll be able to figure out how (all data dumps are dirty, but not all shit is created equal).<br><br> 1. Ensure that your data has headings!    <br>\ta. Headings are essential not just because they're a logical way to organize    your variables, but they're are also REQUIRED to build a pivot table down the road, if even one of your columns doesn't have a heading, Excel won't play nice! <br>2. Ensure that your headings don't repeat themselves    <br>\ta. While this may seem obvious, if a heading repeats itself, Excel won't pivot properly, won't graph correctly AND won't upload properly in external tools (such as Microsoft Access, which we'll explore in a later post!) <br>3. Ensure that multiple sources are all located on the same Excel workbook (basically, if you're pulling data from multiple places, that you paste them all into the same Excel file).    <br>\ta. Note that since Excel 2007, this step isn't 100% necessary, but it makes things much faster in both ease of use, and in the computational sense. <br>4. And finally, ensure that your variables are in the correct format...which is what we'll focus on for the rest of this post.<br><br>Often, data dumps combine multiple variables into one \"string\" (a set of characters with no other format) most often last names, first names, and ID numbers which is fine when you're trying to figure out how many Smith,Bob,8675309s exist in your data...so basically useless on it's own. This brings us to the title of this post: how we're going to slice up (or \"Parse\") this string so that it's useful to us. <br><br>There are a few was of going about this, but in my experience the most useful is some combination of the following formulae:<br> <code>=LEFT</code> which returns a specified number of characters from the start of a string. <br><code>=RIGHT</code> which returns a specified number of characters from the end of the string. <br><code>=MID</code>  which returns a specified number of characters from a defined point in the string <br><code>=LEN</code> which returns the number of characters in the string, and <br><code>=FIND</code> which returns the location of a specified character or string within a string. Just a word to the wise, starting from the beginning is always 0, not 1 in any of these examples. <br><br>Assuming you've got some android in you, you notice that <code>=left</code> and <code>=right</code> are basically useless if you need to break up a string (but can be useful if you wind up with a data dump that gives you a preset amount of garbage to throw away each time, or as a second step in this process). Instead, we're going to leverage the fact that Data Dumps are generally exported in Comma Separated Format (CSV) which means that there are going to be a lot of commas for you to set as \"flags\" where you want to break things up. Take the example I gave you before: Smith,Bob,8675309s. <br>This is actually a particularly mean example because you're going to need to break it into three steps for which there are multiple solutions, simply because there's more than one comma to \"put your flag down\". One way you can go about it is as such: </p><p>First use the \"mid\" function alongside the \"find\" command in order to separate the last name from the first name and ID, like so: <code>=MID(A1,FIND(\",\",A1)+1,LEN(A1))</code><br>The result of this will be Bob,8675309, and the reason why the +1 is included is so that we don't include the comma (which would start this whole circus again)<br>From there, you can repeat the steps on the newly created Bob,8675309 in order to obtain the ID.</p><p>Once you have the ID number, if you return to the original string and perform <code>=left(A1(find(\",\",A1)-1)</code> (the -1 removes the first comma as opposed to the second) you'll get \"Smith\"<br><br>Finally, you can go to the Bob,8675309 string (which we'll say is located in B1) and perform the same steps in order to get \"Bob\" all by itself. </p><p>With all that being said, until we get a bit more advanced (yes, you can do this in fewer steps), assume you need one formula per comma in order to \"parse\" each section, and you'll find your way. The benefit of breaking it down this way is that you can drag the formula down and it'll perform the exact same steps regardless of how long the initial string is, as long as it has 3 commas. <br><br>So, what have we learned? </p><ol><li>We've learned to slice up data dumps</li><li>We've learned to dice up the resultant strings and finally</li><li>We've learned how to take a small bit of useless garbage and turn it into variables that we can use in further analysis via slicing and dicing. </li></ol><p>So you see?

Think about other binary decisions you've made in your life: Yes, or no,\nOdd or Even, Coke or Pepsi (despite what RC cola would like you to think), and\nperhaps the most bemoaned of all for everyone who has ever been a student: True\nor False.\n\nInterestingly, this true/false dichotomy is the very essence of how all of the\nchopping and screwing you'll be doing on your messy data (and in fact, the\nmajority of all computer programming) begins; by simply asking Excel if  what\nyou typed in is true...or false.\n\nNow that you've been successfully induced, we can jump into the the technical\nstuff. As you may have garnered from my post about formulae, Excel actually has,\nDEEP within it's bowels, a fairly robust programming language underpinning it:\nVisual Basic for Applications (VBA). Now, there are two general ways to tap into\nit:\n\n 1. The way that the majority of wizards do it: through the function bar (that\n    is, typing an \"=\" and letting it rip), and...\n 2. The way that the particularly adept wizards engage in it: through the\n    command line, which I'm not going to bother touching here, because if you're\n    writing entire Excel spreadsheets in VBA, why are you still using Excel?\n    Move onto Python or R and continue feeling smugly superior!\n\nSo, with that being said, how does one tap into this unlimited wellspring of\npotential using nothing but the features on the Excel mainpage? Well, I already\ntold you, simply ask Excel =If()!\nAll flowery language and allegory aside, the majority of computer programming\nlanguages (the one underneath Excel included) hinge on this \"If\" statement, the\nonly difference is how the particular language wants you to write these\nstatements.\n\nIn the Excel parlance, when one types in =If(  you'll be asked for three things\nseparated by commas (that Excel could really make a bit clearer), they are:\n\n 1. The logical argument (AKA, what do you want Excel to check as being true or\n    false?) A good example would be say \"Does the value in Cell A1 equal the\n    value of the Cell in B1?\" which would be written as =if(A1=B1 (Protip!, \n    unlike other programming languages, the way you write \"does not equal\" in\n    Excel is <>)\n 2. The value you want to grab if the value is true (leaving this blank will\n    just write \"true\") but in this case, let's make it say \"Yes\". This will be\n    written as =if(A1=B1,\"Yes\".(Protip!,  within Excel, if ever you want to\n    return something other than a number  you always need to surround it in\n    quotation marks.)\n 3. The value that you want to return if the value is false (leaving this blank\n    will just write \"false\") in this case, let's make it say \"No\". This will be\n    written as =if(A1=B1,\"Yes\",\"No\").\n\nAfter completing this formula with the three elements followed by a closing\nparenthesis, you'll get a cell that either says \"Yes\" or \"No\" depending on if A1\nand B1 contain the same values. The powerful thing here is what comes next: by\ndouble clicking the lower right hand corner of the cell with the formula, it'll\nautomatically populate all of the rows which are adjacent to information with Ax\n= Bx (where x equals the row number) allowing you to check each row to see if\nthe two columns match!\n\nTo add an extra wrinkle, let's say you want to check to see if each cell in a\ncolumn is equal to the values in a specific cell, you'd do that as follows:\n=if(A1 = $B$1,\"Yes\",\"No\"). If you then double click the cell as you did before,\nthat will check every value in column A against ONLY the value in B1. By adding\nthe dollar sign to the location of the cell, You've identified the \"Absolute\nReference\" as opposed to the \"Relative Reference\". Feel free to disregard these\nnames immediately, and start referring to it as \"dollar sign\". You can even\nmanipulate it by only using the Absolute reference on the row (A$1) OR the\ncolumn ($A1) if you're populating , vertically, horizontally, or both (yes,\ntechnically putting B$1 in the above example would have gotten you the same\nanswers).\n\nIn summation, in this post we've learned:\n\n 1. Excel is actually built on top of a \"real\" programming language called VBA.\n 2. You can write tiny programs in Excel through the function bar (or big\n    programs through the command line...showoff).\n 3. All \"programming\" really is, is the manipulation of true/false statements\n    underpinning the binary code even further beneath all computational tasks.\n 4. How to write your own \"If\" statement in Excel and how to \"phrase\" the\n    returning of numbers vs. anything else using quotation marks.\n 5. How to utilize the absolute reference (AKA the \"Dollar Sign\") to change what\n    gets included in the statements in each line of your spreadsheet.\n\nNext time, we'll get more grammatically complex, leveraging Ands and Ors in our\nIfs.

I\nhighly recommend you go back and read the first post on \"dirty\" data, but just\nin case you're one of those rebels who thinks that they're too cool to read part\n1, here's a quick refresher to put you back in the analytical mindset (which is\nthe perfect combination tactical laziness, ADHD, and a complete disregard for\ndownside risk).\n\nEssentially, the reason why most data analysts exist within a company (remember,\nNOT a tech company, hence the usage of Excel) is because for whatever reason,\nmost companies do not give analysts access to the data on demand, and instead it\nis tightly controlled by a mysterious cabal of DBAs or developers which I have\nchristened the dataratti.\n\nWhile this setup is workable in theory, the dataratti often do not have a strong\nunderstanding of how the data is used in practice, and there are generally not\nopen lines of communication between the dataratti and the analysts. Thus it\nfalls upon the analyst to do three crucial jobs:\n\n 1. Obtain raw  data from the dataratti (remember, raw means that the data is\n    just a bunch of numbers, words, and headings...meaningless on their own).\n 2. manipulate  the data so that it's in a readable format and does not have\n    unnecessary data.\n 3. Present this data in narrative form to the business people.\n\nNow, you may be asking why they can't just hire someone who knows both sides of\nthis equation, the answer is sadly simple: manipulating data in a tool like\nExcel is antithetical to the general idea of how databases are created (we'll\ntalk about that some more next time) and thus someone who has both skill-sets,\nas well as the ability to present to stakeholders (remember, Those Who Sit Above\nin Shadow?) is extremely rare, and trying to become  that person may not be the\nbest idea because it may actually be cheaper to hire two employees than hire\nsomeone with chops in both skills (and you can't just know  how to\nmanipulate/present and code, you have to know both very well).\n\nWith all that being said, last time we discussed how one might grab data from\nthe dataratti from a tool like Tableau (which is essentially a data\nvisualization toolkit that's really good at creating dashboards, but can only\nhandle limited variables...a.k.a. columns, and exports the actual data in a\nparticularly messy way). Now we'll talk about one of the other possibilities for\nthe enterprising analyst to grab raw data: Business Intelligence (BI) tools.\n\nDespite how cool it sounds and despite it immediately conjuring thoughts of\nengaging in corporate espionage as part of the Business Intelligence Agency, BI\nis at it's core really just an interface where someone who didn't design a\ndatabase can still query (that literally means \"ask\") the database for the data\nthat they want.\n\nThe way this works is pretty straightforward: there will be an interface with a\nseries of folders (just like you'd see on a desktop) and within each, there will\nbe a list of variables that you can drag-and-drop into your query. After putting\nin all of the variables that you want in your report, you just hit \"go\" and\nit'll show you all of the data associated with the variables...essentially\nletting you grab data from the database without touching it, and without knowing\nSQL. To sweeten the already sweet deal, you can even generally manipulate the\ndata after the query is done but before downloading (using a very similar format\nto Excel, although, why fix what ain't broken?), and you can set it up to re-run\nwhatever query you decided upon on a regular schedule.\n\nWell then, doesn't that just sound ideal, why didn't I lead with this clearly\nsuperior strategy? Obviously, there's a catch: not only are BI toolkits VERY\nexpensive, the implementation of a BI tool requires an entire OTHER level of\nemployee between the coders and the analysts. Remember way back when, in a\nprevious post, I stated that databases only build on top of themselves and grow\nincreasingly unwieldy the longer your company is in existence? Also, remember\nwhen I stated that the developers rarely know why their users need the data\nwithin the database? Well, that leads to the developers coding their databases\nin a way that only they  truly understand (if we were talking about anything\nother than a database, I'd even say that their code is...inelegant). Now imagine\nhaving having to take this mess of code on top of code that's starting to look\nlike Tetsuo at the end of Akira, and translating all of it to plain English that\nsomeone with no knowledge of database structures would be able to understand,\nand you're starting to get an idea of the struggle that a BI developer has ahead\nof them. To make matters worse, each BI tool requires this to be done in a\nspecific way, so the skills are only moderately transferable. Of note, in a\ncompany that relies on their data quite a bit, and when their database is\nconsiderably large, this quickly becomes a full-time job, if not the job of a\nsmall team.\n\nNow, despite the considerable front-end investment in a good BI team, the\nflexibility of being able to grab data on-demand ends up being significantly\nbetter in the long-term, especially when an analyst knows how to use tableau\nthemselves, and can make super slick graphic representations of the data...and\neveryone knows that the way to a business person's heart is with sick graphics.\n\nIn summary, today we explored the following:\n\n * A refresher of the counter-intuitive model of data siloing within companies.\n * An explanation of the role of an analyst within this company hierarchy.\n * How BI tools work and what some of the benefits and challenges of\n   implementation may be.\n\nNow that you know why the data you get comes out dirty, next time, we'll explore\nsome examples of how your data may arrive, and how to sculpt your data so that\nyou can make it work for you.\n\nPaz,\n\n-Snacks","html":"<p>In my last post, we explored the organizational structure of many large companies and how this pertains to one's duties as a fledgling data analyst.

Note that this is a study with an N\n= 1 so it bares no statistical significance, but I have a funny feeling...call\nit spidey sense).\n\nFull disclosure, this post comes mostly out of my inability to sleep in my hotel\nroom in Chicago following a grueling day of doing the very things I discuss in\nthis blog, and preceding a day where I'll have to literally explain my last post\nto the suits, but perhaps this is the best mindset to begin discussing the\nmyriad ways in which you may encounter dirty data in the wild, and how a savvy\nanalyst may pivot and match their way around it. However, if my prose isn't as\non point as you have grown accustomed...blame it on the 4AM haze.\n\nAlas, let's begin by discussing the organizational structure of the majority of\ncorporate entities that leverage data to some degree (note, this isn't all\ncorporations...and what does that say about the state of business?) and how, at\neach step of abstraction in this process that you are from the data, the data\ngets dirtier and dirtier.\n\nEssentially, there's always going to be a group of about 5-10\nfewer-than-necessary legitimately skilled data scientists and/or computer\nprogrammers/DBAs who are really solid at building and maintaining a database as\nwell as coding in some sort of compiling language (nowadays, that's probably\npython, but not exclusively, nor does this matter). However, depending on your\nindustry (unless of course your industry IS data), it's nearly impossible to\nrecruit people who have these skills to the level necessary AND have some\nfamiliarity with why this data is needed, and/or the ability to explain how the\ninternal products that they build can be used by an end user. As such, this team\nhas their own project manager(s) who's only job is to keep these guys from\ndeveloping a sentient AI that's sole goal is the annihilation of unfolded\nlaundry...when your industry is healthcare. This team should also have at least\none analyst who will take the raw code base and do the first step of translation \n to a more user friendly form. This generally takes shape as either dashboards\nin a system like Tableau, or  if your company has a group of particularly strong\ndata/business analysts (or particularly weak programmers) an interface written\nin plain(enough) English on a Business Intelligence platform such as Microsoft\nBI/SAP Business Objects or whatever other system your company utilizes. As a fun\nlittle note, this team ALMOST ALWAYS  is referred to by some sort of acronym\nsuch as QDAR! (Quality data and reporting!) or KMnR! (Knowledge management and\nreporting!) or Those Fucking Guys (who have something to do with reporting)\n(TFG(whstdwr)). On a less fun little note...neither you, nor seemingly ANYONE\nELSE will have contact with this team. In light of this information, how do the\nreports that they build get chosen and who decides how these databases are\nbuilt? The world may never know.\n\nSo let's assume the first type of reporting: the Dataratti  (which is how I will\nrefer to the acronym defined team described above moving forward) produces\ndashboards utilizing a tool such as Tableau or Crystal Reports. You may be\nthinking to yourself: \"hey, isn't my job taking the data and putting it in a\nform where people who are scared by more than two nested groups of parenthesis,\nand thus this renders my job unnecessary?\" The answer to the question is\ntwofold: Yes, and of course not! As mentioned previously, the decision to create\nthese dashboards, the data contained therein, and how you want them to look is\ndecided upon by a mythical creature who has full access and understanding of the\ndata warehouse, AND has full access to and understanding of the stakeholders\n(AKA, Those Who Sit Above in Shadow; that's a reference from a famous run of\nThor comics that refers to to a mysterious cabal of gods who perpetuate the\ncycle of Ragnarok in order to subsist upon the energies created by this\nstrife...which as I write this, is an almost disgustingly on-the-nose metaphor\nfor upper management). Now, if you believe that you may be this mythical\ncreature (as I do), I DARE  you to apply for a job with this job description,\nand once you clinch it with the advice from this blog,  rapidly realize that\nyour job will involve either one of these job duties or the other.\n\nWith that digression, even if somehow a useful dashboard for YOU is created, the\nlimitations inherent in these dashboarding tools make one CRUCIAL issue\nomnipresent: one can only effectively illustrate up to 16 different variables at\na time before the system breaks down (for example, Tableau's documentation\nspecifically warns against this). So even if you have the nicest, most\nillustrative dashboards on the planet from the Dataratti, there is a nearly 100%\nchance that the information that you actually need will be scattered across 2-3\ndifferent dashboards...rendering the nice looking dashboards essentially useless\nfor your purposes, and as previously stated, you have no contact with the\nDataratti, nor do you have access to the underlying data from which these\ndashboards are created. So pop quiz hot shot, what DO you do?\n\nWell, mercifully, all of these dashboard tools allow an end user to download a\n\"data dump\" (our parlance for \"a buncha numbers with headings\"). Using Tableau\nas an example, one can download either a \"crosstab\" or a text file of the data\nrepresented by the dashboard (in both \"summary\" and \"full data\" format). Now,\njust to get the truly gifted in Tableau off my back, yes, the functionality does\nexist to build in the ability to download the data in the exact format necessary\nfor your  needs through a specific combination of custom web server views and\nJavascript, but...\n\n 1. If the users of the dash are exclusively using this function, why do the\n    dashboard at all? And...\n 2. This forces the developers in the Dataratti to have decent web design skills\n    on top of really high level Tableau skills, and it requires someone to\n    anticipate exactly how the data will be used by the end user by the\n    Dataratti (which is incredibly hard as it's impossible to speak to this\n    department directly, and as previously stated, the lack of this  knowledge\n    on their end is the entire reason why my department exists).\n\nA few things to note before downloading data from Tableau:\n\n * You must highlight at least one element of the dashboard before downloading a\n   crosstab.\n * Depending on what kind of dashboard you're working with, you may need to\n   highlight the entirety of one column in order to capture the entirety of your\n   data (click the first element in any column  and then scroll down to the\n   bottom of the report...which may be enormously long, hit shift  and click the\n   last element in the report) before downloading either the data or the\n   crosstab.\n * If you are downloading a crosstab, be wary, Tableau web server caps how many\n   rows you can download in this method at a time, this can be avoided by\n   downloading the text version of the data (by clicking data as opposed to\n   crosstab). HOWEVER...\n * If you are going the data route, it defaults to summary view. Look over all\n   the headings, and ensure that this covers everything you need, otherwise\n   click \"full data\". Interestingly, this still isn't actually the entirety of\n   your data, and continue to check to make sure all of your headings are\n   covered, otherwise, click the display all columns  box, and then download all\n   the rows as a text file.\n\nNow, repeat these steps until all of the data that you need in your  report is\ncontained across these text files (.csv, AKA the Comma Separated Value file\ntype). With all that lunacy completed, you now have several sheets with some\ncommon columns, but all with different information; only some of which you need,\nso what do you think you do?\n\nSimple, you use the tools given to you in the previous posts: you lookup  on the\ncommon factors across the sheets and return the data that you want until you\nhave all the data you need, in the correct order, on one sheet, and then\ndepending on the ask, you may want to pivot that data out in order to summarize \nthe whole mess of data. THIS IS YOUR FINAL PRODUCT  well done. Another protip:\nif you want to reposition data that you've obtained via a lookup, highlight the\nwhole column, hit control+C  to copy the data and then hit control+V  pause a\nsecond (press NOTHING else) and then press control FOLLOWED by V. This takes the\nvalues generated by a formula and replaces them with the values obtained.\nFunctionally, this looks  exactly the same, but now you can move the data around\nwithout affecting or being affected by other data.\n\nAs explaining only one possible dirty data scenario took over 1500 words, next\ntime, we'll discuss the other most common form of taking the dirty data from the\nDataratti and making it useful to you: using business intelligence portals as\nopposed to dashboards in order to grab the data that you need. Also, if I don't\nget roasted on a spit for being half asleep for tomorrow's (today's?) meeting,\nI'll try and write up a companion post with an example of how this works out in\npractice.\n\nIn summary, in this post we've learned:\n\n 1. How data is generally siloed and sequestered within the corporate\n    environment, leading to a bevy of unnecessary steps on behalf of the analyst\n    in order to distill a functional report for the powers-that-be\n 2. Two major methods in which data comes from the data team (henceforth known\n    as the Dataratti) to your team: Dashboards and Business Intelligence\n    interfaces, and...\n 3. Assuming you get data in the form of dashboards, how to take these\n    dashboards, download the underlying data, recombine and manipulate the data,\n    and package it in a way acceptable for your needs.\n\nCongrats, you've just learned the crucial skill of the Slice n' Dice!\n\nQuite sleepily,\n\n-Snacks","html":"<p>In my last post, we discussed what separates a <em>true</em> analyst (read: technical) from a project manager wearing the mask of an analyst like some Scott Snyder era Joker (I figure that there's a solid overlap between fans of comic books and fans of the real world application of data.

However, I've neglected to discuss\nwhat types of things you'll actually encounter out in the wild that requires\nsome fancy Excel footwork. Well, that's what this post is all about.\n\nThe first question: what is Excel actually for. Truth be told, if you separate\nthe VB elements and the pivot tables from Excel, it was really just a way for\naccountants to make small changes to tax forms and have them reflected later in\nthe form (something that had to be done by hand prior to the invention of\nExcel's progenitor...which had to have been horrible). With that in mind, one\nneeds to understand that everything else that Excel can do is built on top  of\nthis relatively rudimentary foundation, and interestingly enough, the vast\nmajority of software functions in the same way: for example, the reason why the\nlast dozen or so Bethesda games all have similar glitches and gameplay is\nbecause they're all built on a nearly decade old engine, and anyone who works at\na company that managed a database for a lengthy period of time knows that it's\nmuch easier to build on top of the garbage than to clean anything up (that's\nalso why there's all that cut content that still exists in games when you used a\ngame genie as a kid...it's too difficult to take that stuff out without harming\nthe juicy center!).\n\nThe pros of this model is that because Excel was made to handle accounting work,\nit handles relatively small datasets (and \"small\" here is under a million\nrows...I've managed to push excel to about 250k rows without it exploding...but\nnot much more than that) very quickly, and in a very user friendly and visual\nformat. In other words, Your boss uses Excel because it's pretty easy to\nunderstand what's going on (and you can see  the data). As such, you can think\nof Excel as the \"Lingua Franca\" (the language that two dignitaries of separate\nnations speak to conduct diplomacy...or perhaps, the Basic to your Star Wars\nUniverse) of the data world. To put this as simply as possible, unless you're\nworking for a company where EVERYONE has a background in computer/data science,\nyou're going to need to figure out a way to get your data into an Excel friendly\nformat somehow. The reason for this may have to do with self selection, people\nwho like getting into code go into heavy data, people like me who like to fix\nproblems tend to be intermediaries, and the people who actually make money for\nour companies (or at least are able to convince others that money is made)...are\nbusiness people.\n\nNow brace yourself, because this sounds completely insane: the daily workflow of\na Business Analyst (or a BA) at many companies is taking data that already\nexists in one form on one platform (generally either tableau, a business\nintelligence program, or some sort of database), exporting it to an Excel\nfriendly format, manipulating the data so it makes sense, drawing some sort of\nsalient conclusion from it (usually using a lookup, a pivot, or both),\npresenting it to management, and then putting it back into a format that the\nheavy data people can use to start this engine all over again.\n\nThe funny part is, the actual mechanics of doing this work isn't hard, if\neveryone is on the same page, you could probably take care of this whole\nworkflow in maybe half a day. Alas, blogs like this wouldn't need to be written\nif mechanics always worked the way they should, and another golden rule is that\nmultiple departments are never  on the same page. In other words, the data you\nget is going to be \"dirty\" and next time, I'm going to show you some common\ndirty data dilemmas, and how to polish it up with nothing but a few = signs, a\ncouple of commands, a pivot table or two, and a shitload of ingenuity.\n\nBut as always, a summary. In this post, we learned:\n\n * What Excel is good at\n * What Excel perhaps isn't so good at\n * Why you still need to deal with Excel\n * The day to day of someone who deals in both the data space and the management\n   space...and\n * That troubleshooting this step is what ultimately earns you your paycheck.\n\nFinally, a quick aside to placate my fellow authors and friends on this fine\nblog, your data being dirty on my end doesn't mean you did anything wrong, it's\nthat bouncing from one platform to another and back was never meant to be easy.","html":"<p>If you've been reading along, over the last several posts you've learned the two major skills that any self-respecting Excel jockey counts as their go-tos: the ability to <em>lookup</em> (remember, I'm partial to index-match, but if you learned VH lookup, ride that until you crash your system) and the ability to <em>pivot</em>.</p><p>Now here's something really interesting: until we pierce the veil on doing some VB macros, by truly mastering just those two skills, you can handle basically any job that Excel can actually handle, anything more advanced is just a matter of doing it faster (and faster, and faster).

With that in mind, one needs to understand that everything else that Excel can do is built <strong>on top</strong> of this relatively rudimentary foundation, and interestingly enough, the vast majority of software functions in the same way: for example, the reason why the last dozen or so Bethesda games all have similar glitches and gameplay is because they're all built on a nearly decade old engine, and anyone who works at a company that managed a database for a lengthy period of time knows that it's much easier to build on top of the garbage than to clean anything up (that's also why there's all that cut content that still exists in games when you used a game genie as a kid...it's too difficult to take that stuff out without harming the juicy center!).</p><p>The pros of this model is that because Excel was made to handle accounting work, it handles relatively small datasets (and \"small\" here is under a million rows...I've managed to push excel to about 250k rows without it exploding...but not much more than that) very quickly, and in a very user friendly and visual format. In other words, Your boss uses Excel because it's pretty easy to understand what's going on (and you can <strong>see</strong> the data). As such, you can think of Excel as the \"Lingua Franca\" (the language that two dignitaries of separate nations speak to conduct diplomacy...or perhaps, the Basic to your Star Wars Universe) of the data world. To put this as <em>simply as possible</em>, unless you're working for a company where EVERYONE has a background in computer/data science, you're going to need to figure out a way to get your data into an Excel friendly format somehow. The reason for this may have to do with self selection, people who like getting into code go into heavy data, people like me who like to fix problems tend to be intermediaries, and the people who actually make money for our companies (or at least are able to convince others that money is made)...are business people.</p><p>Now brace yourself, because this sounds completely insane: the daily workflow of a Business Analyst (or a BA) at many companies is taking data that already exists in one form on one platform (generally either tableau, a business intelligence program, or some sort of database), exporting it to an Excel friendly format, manipulating the data so it makes sense, drawing some sort of salient conclusion from it (usually using a lookup, a pivot, or both), presenting it to management, and then putting it back into a format that the heavy data people can use to start this engine all over again.</p><p>The funny part is, the actual mechanics of doing this work isn't hard, if everyone is on the same page, you could probably take care of this whole workflow in maybe half a day. Alas, blogs like this wouldn't need to be written if mechanics always worked the way they should, and another golden rule is that multiple departments are <strong>never</strong> on the same page. In other words, the data you get is going to be \"dirty\" and next time, I'm going to show you some common dirty data dilemmas, and how to polish it up with nothing but a few = signs, a couple of commands, a pivot table or two, and a shitload of ingenuity.</p><p>But as always, a summary.

Hopefully this gave you a feel of how a pivot table works, and if\nyour synapses are wired in a very specific way  you may even begin to feel out\nwhy pivot tables are such a game-changer. With this base in mind, in this post,\nwe're going to learn what each of those buckets actually do, and explore some\nreally cool ways that you can mess with your raw data within the pivot\nenvironment.\n\nBefore we go further, we must first understand some foundation facts about\nworking with Pivots that will save you heartache and frustration out of the\nprocess:\n\n 1.   Remember, any data within the pivot table does not affect the raw data,\n    this makes pivot tables the ideal way to look at your data through different\n    lenses. \n 2.   You can utilize a heading in your pivot table in multiple locations (or\n    even multiple times in the same location!) to view your data in different\n    ways. The exact way this works is difficult to explain, so try it yourself\n    and find out. \n 3.   Any changes to your raw data (especially if you didn't highlight the\n    entirety of your data) will not  be reflected in the pivot table UNLESS you\n    right click the table, and press \"refresh\", this will then take into account\n    any data changed in the raw data (assuming that the change took place within\n    the area you highlighted, if you add a column or row, you need to redo the\n    table) \n 4.   You can copy/paste any part of the pivot table, and contents that you\n    highlighted to copy will appear. HOWEVER, if you highlight all  visible\n    parts of the pivot table, you'll actually copy the whole pivot (which you\n    can continue modifying). This is very useful if you want to make a minor\n    change to a pivot table, and compare them side by side (we'll dive deeper\n    into this topic in a later post). \n 5.   This isn't exclusive to pivot tables, but remember the absolute golden\n    rule  of Excel: much like an obnoxiously large Leatherman (or a Swiss army\n    knife, depending on how over-prepared you want to be) while there are nearly\n    infinite tools or settings available, a hypermajority  of Excel users will\n    never touch even half of the options available, and are still strong in the\n    ways of magic (#wizard), so just because you can press all the buttons,\n    doesn't mean you should. \n\nWith all three of these rules in mind, let's dive into each of the buckets, what\nthey do, and how you can use this to really start to get wild with your data.\nLet's start with the most straightforward:\n\nFilters\nThe filter bucket allows you to place one (or more!) of your headings (AKA your\ncolumns in the raw data) in order to filter in or out those values out of the\nentire pivot table. For instance, If you have a column of people's names, and\nyou put names into the filter bucket, you can then choose the names that you\nwant to include the associated data. One great use for the filter bucket is if\nyou have a dataset with dates, you can filter out a specific Month/Day/Year and\nthe rest of your data will only display information from that particular time\nperiod.\n\nRows\nRows are the bread and butter of a pivot table (and as we discussed last time,\nthe thing that clicking on a heading defaults to). This is the main area where\nyour data will live. For example, if you have a dataset of Names, IDs, and\nBirthdays, and you click Names, the pivot table will show all of the DISTINCT \nnames in a column within the pivot. For example, if you have the dataset of\nnames:\n\nCOLUMN A COLUMN B Bob Sally Bob Jim Tom Larry Bob Your pivot table will display:\n\nCOLUMN A COLUMN B Bob Sally Jim Tom Larry In other words, it treats all Bobs the\nsame, and this functionality is *Muy importanté\n\nHowever, what if you want to see how many Bobs exist within your data? Well...\n\nValues\nThe values tab is perhaps the most flexible part of the pivot table. By putting\na heading within the value tab, it will default to showing you the Count, or the\nnumber of appearances that a particular value shows up within a column of your\ndataset. So for example, if you drag names into both the row and values buckets,\nyou'll wind up with this (a pivot table will always show a grand total (unless\nyou specifically tell the pivot not to, which is a possibility, however, because\nyou can copy and paste any part of the pivot, it's rarely necessary):\n\n             COLUMN ACOLUMN B        Bob3        Sally1        Bob1        Jim1\n       Tom1        **Total****7**\n\nNow, notice that above I said that by dragging a heading into the values bucket\nit'll default to a count (unless the column is all numbers, then it'll default\nto a sum), however, this is not the only possibility. By left clicking the\nheading within the value bucket and choosing \"value field settings), you can\nchoose from a mind-boggling array of possible mathematical operations, the ones\nthat you will generally use most often are probably going to be count  (the\nnumber of appearances of a given value within a dataset) and sum  (the combined\ntotal of all the numbers associated with each value in your row bucket). One\nimportant piece of advice though, you can not  sum text, Excel won't let you\n(even if the text looks like a number), so if you're using numbers, be sure to\ntell Excel that you're looking at numbers (this issue will happen more often\nthan you could possibly imagine!)\n\nOther useful operators are count distinct  (which you can only utilize if you\nchecked add to data model  when you built the table) and min or max (returning\nthe lowest or highest value associated with a particular value in your rows, and\nyou can only use this if you did not  click add to data model  when you built\nthe table). A good example of using Max or Min is when you have say names and\nsalaries, where you can show the highest and lowest salary for a particular\nname. Keep in mind that you can have more than one value operator (like min and\nmax) per heading, thus putting both the minimum and maximum value next to each\nother on the table. Which leads us to the generally least used bucket...\n\nColumns\nOne thing I intentionally left out was what a pivot table actually does  with\nyour data. A gross over-simplification of the functionality is that it\nconsolidates (picking out those distinct values), summarizes (shows totals, and\ngrand totals), and most importantly, it flips your columns and rows (hence the\nreason it's called a pivot  table.) Thus, the column bucket is generally just\nused as a place where your values go automatically when you populate the values\nbucket. The reason columns get kind of cumbersome is because it literally widens\nyour pivot by how many ever values exist in your dataset, thus, anything more\nthan say 20 values becomes almost impossible to read, let alone use in a\nmeaningful way.\n\nThere are some rare cases in which using a heading in the column bucket may make\nsense though, for instance, if you have birth months as one of your headings,\nand names for rows, you can put the months in the column bucket and then get a\ncount showing each how many people with a particular name land at a particular\nmonth in a grid or \"heat map\" (a fancy way to say a chart showing concentrations\nof something) fashion. Another use case (and one I use on the day to day) is\nfinding the numbers of providers who utilize a particular procedure for which\nthere is a known value (there are 12 that I look at). You have the procedure\nnames as the columns, and you have the providers who administer the procedures\nas the rows. You then put measure in the value bucket. This gives me a nice,\nconcise grid for which I can see which providers give how many of which of the\n12 procedures...which on it's own is sorta useful, but when combined with a\ntrick we already learned, some epic level spellcasting is afoot. Unfortunately,\nthat'll have to wait until next time.\n\nIn summary, we learned:\n\n * The purpose of the filter bucket within a pivot table\n * The purpose of the rows bucket within a pivot table and the fact that it\n   shows distinct values\n * The purpose of the values bucket within a pivot table, and how you can have\n   the column use different mathematical operators (such as count, sum, min, and\n   max) to find different information within a dataset... and\n * The purpose (or lack thereof) of the columns bucket within a pivot table, and\n   potential use case scenarios for this function.\n\nNext time, we start combining knowledge in order to get freaky with your data in\nways that the lord of Excel themselves did not consider.\n\nPivot till you puke,\n\n-Snacks","html":"<p>During the last discussion, you've (hopefully) learned how to generate a pivot table, and learned about the four \"buckets\" that can house your columns:</p><ul><li>Filter</li><li>Row</li><li>Column</li><li>Value</li></ul><p>I'm also going to make the wild assumption that you've played around with your newly birthed pivot table, taking your column headings from your \"raw\" data (in the lingua franca of the numerically inclined, this means the data just as you've received it, before you add formulae or engage in any other manipulation.)

Simply put, building a pivot table is the reason \nwhy Excel is still used at all (and as of about a month ago, Google Sheets has\npivot tables too, so that's encouraging). It essentially offers a way to \nsummarize your data  and quickly draw conclusions from a bunch of random rows\nand columns. If that sounds very powerful, you're correct, and it would be easy\nenough to write an entire book just about pivot tables (and I'm sure these books\nexist), but right now, we're just going to learn to build one.\n\nThe good news is, pivoting doesn't even require a formula to exist, it only\nrequires at least two columns with headings  (this is the number one reason for\npivot tables not working out) and the desire to succeed.\n\nHere's how to do it:\n\n 1. MAKE SURE ALL OF YOUR COLUMNS HAVE HEADINGS\n 2. Highlight all of the data you want to pivot (there's the sucker way to do\n    this: pressing control-A  to highlight everything, and the more accurate\n    way: highlight the first heading, and then hit control+shift+right  to\n    highlight all the headings, and then control+shift+down  to highlight all\n    the data related to those headings, this removes blanks from the pivot\n    table). Ultimately though, highlight the data anyway that makes you happy,\n    the important thing is to include all the data you want to pivot out.\n 3. Click insert at the top of your screen (in between home and page\n    layout...not the inset key), alternatively, you can hit Alt+D and then P to\n    open the wizard, but the wizard actually makes things more difficult (in my\n    opinion, of course). Then click \"pivot table\" (it's right underneath).\n 4. This will launch another window, the table/range will already be populated\n    if you've followed these steps as directed, so the only thing you need to\n    concern yourself with is if you want the pivot table on a new sheet\n    (probably), or if you want to place it on an existing sheet (maybe at some\n    point, but not now). 4b. I purposely left out that checkbox regarding\n    \"adding the data to the data model\", for our purposes, checking the check\n    box will let you figure out the number of different  values (this is called\n    a distinct count) but it WON'T let you find the Maximum or Minimum value. To\n    be honest, I have no idea why this is. For most purposes though, leave the\n    box unchecked.\n 5. Click OK...you now have a weird looking blank box that'll become your pivot\n    table.\n\nNow, click the weird looking box, and you'll see a menu on the right side of\nyour screen, the top half of which will consist of the headings that you\nhighlighted, the bottom consists of 4 distinct boxes that you can drag these\nheadings into: filters,columns,rows, and values.\n\nNow, take one of your headings, and drag it into the rows box (or just click it,\nExcel defaults to putting headings in the rows box) you'll now see a column of \ndistinct  values in the formally blank table. Honestly, the best way to learn is\nto just drag headings into each of the 4 boxes, their functions rapidly become\nself evident...and here's the best part: the pivot table doesn't make any\nchanges to your existing data, so any craziness you engage in on the pivot\ntable...stays in the pivot table, so don't worry about messing up the data that\nyour boss gave you.\n\nSo, I'll leave you with that, your homework today is to try and plug each of\nyour headings into each of the 4 options offered, remember, it's almost\nimpossible to break a pivot table, it's easy to make it useless, but it's\nequally easy to reset it back to normal.\n\nToday we've learned:\n\n * That the combination of lookup skills and pivot skills makes up the entry\n   level data professional's resume\n * The most basic of overview of what a pivot table is\n * The steps to set up a pivot table\n * How to interact with a pivot table once it's been created.\n\nNext time, we'll go over what each of the 4 pivot \"buckets\" actually do, and how\nto utilize each of them to get a different view of your dataset.\n\nHappy Pivoting,\n\n-Snacks","html":"<p>As previously discussed, the entry level data professional (coming from a background other than statistics, math, or computer science) consists of two keywords: The ability to <strong>lookup</strong> and the ability to <strong>pivot</strong>.</p><p>Dear reader, this is not an oversimplification or hyperbole, the hard truth is that if someone has a reasonable familiarity with a lookup function (remember, cool kids use Index-Match), and equal familiarity with how to use pivot tables, you can get most \"day to day\" work done on the job, and if you get really good, by utilizing both of these tools in creative ways you can essentially hack at any problem thrown at you.</p><p>So...what is a <strong>pivot table</strong>?
