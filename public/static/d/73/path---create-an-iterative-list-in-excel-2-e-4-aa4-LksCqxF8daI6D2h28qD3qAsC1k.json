What is this you ask? it's a pretty standard\ncomputer programming function (up there with the IF statement and the OR\nstatement) that does a particular thing FOR a certain period of time in which a\nparticular condition is true (like for instance, as long as the person's name\nremains the same. Granted, you can do FOR loops in VBA, but it's not as easy as\nit should be, and we'd probably have to do most of the same steps in order to\nget the full benefit. \n\nHowever, this isn't standard programming...THIS IS EXCEL! As such, we needed to\nget creative, and approximate the FOR loop without using VBA. Here's what we had\nto work with: \n\n * A list of names (in this case, it'll be column A) \n * A unique ID for each of the people on the list (This will be Column B)\n * An issue (in this case, a diagnosis) that each person had, and each line has\n   a different issue, even if it's the same person. (Column C)\n * A bunch of other information that isn't important for this trick. (Who\n   cares?)\n\nHere's how we go about doing it: \n\n 1. Sort the entire list by the ID, that way, the data for the same people are\n    all next to each other. \n 2. Create two new columns, one that does the heavy lifting, and one that\n    signifies (or \"Flags) that Excel should stop iterating. \n 3. In the first of the two created columns (let's put a heading on it called\n    \"combined\") put in the following formula starting with cell D2 and populate\n    your whole column:\n    =IF(B1=B2,CONCATENATE(D1, \";\",C2),C2)\n\n\t\tWhat this is doing is checking to see if the two IDs match (and thus are the\nsame people) and it builds a string combining all of the issues every time\nthere's a match. In the end, column D is going to be the column where the \"work\"\nis done. Of note, the \";\" added in the middle is for aesthetics, feel free to\nignore it, or just plug in some other type of spacer.\n\n\t4. In the second of the created columns (let's call this one \"flag) put in the\nfollowing formula: =IF(B2=B3,\"\",1)\n\n\tThis basically adds a 1 (or whatever you decide to write in) on the last line\nof each loop, signifying that Excel should start the process over on the next\nline instead of continuing to build the string. you start on the cell below the\ninitial cell so that you don't accidentally put the flag on the first line (as\nthe heading and the name is never going to match) This leads us to the final\nstep:\n\n\t5. Filter the sheet by the \"flag\" column for 1, and if so desired, copy and\npaste this filtered list into a new sheet.\n\nThis final step allows you to hide all rows that aren't the final row in the\nloop, thus giving you only 1 line per person with the combined issues that the\nperson had! See below for the finished product.\n\nRemember, the flag column has the following formula =IF(b2=b3,\"\",1)So there you\ngo, using only 2 columns and as many formulas you can easily inject a loop into\nExcel! This technique has many uses, as you may want to continue running a\nformula down a column until a certain \"thing\" happens elsewhere on the\nsheet...the possibilities are endless! \n\nSo today, we've learned the following:\n\n 1. What iterators and FOR loops do in computer programming.\n 2. How to create and utilize an iterator to complete any task that needs to\n    continue running until a particular goal is reached.\n\nNext time, I think we'll probably delve back into Active X and Form controls, so\nthat you can improve the life of your less savvy co-workers, and make yourself\nlook like a boss in the meantime.\n\nSigning off,\n\n-Snacks","html":"<p>Hi there dear reader, so, I know that in the previous article that I penned, I stated that I'd be showing you how to create buttons that you can interact with (and I know you know that because you're reading these in order...right?) but I recently had to create something that was so cool, I had to write about it (once you've drank enough data Kool-Aid, you too will find solutions to data manipulation problems cool).</p><p>Here's the scene: we've got a list of people, each with a particular issue, however, due to why I needed to put the data together, we needed to combine all of the issues that each person had in a single cell for the person they were associated with. </p><p>Now, if this were <em>regular </em>computer programming, the solution would be simple: create an iterative FOR loop.
