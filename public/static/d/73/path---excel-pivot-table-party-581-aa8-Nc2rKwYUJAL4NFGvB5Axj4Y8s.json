Now you may be asking how this\ncould be and the answer is simple: you're curious, get frustrated with monotony,\nand are easily bored. Perhaps you're seeing how this materializes, and if you're\na faithful reader, I know this has happened to you:\n\n * You begin to get frustrated with time consuming spreadsheet tasks (which is\n   what your company thinks you do).\n * Your frustration leads you the realization that there has to be an easier,\n   faster, and possibly even more accurate way (it's much harder to type\n   something wrong when you're not typing it!)\n * Your curiosity leads you to begin researching and eventually implementing a\n   new strategy that does your spreadsheet work for you.\n * You enter a holding pattern where you keep coming up with more and more\n   efficient ways to accomplish your old tasks, and you've probably shared them\n   with your team. \n * Your boss will be mind-boggled with how you're doing this, and will offer you\n   more complex work. \n * You will accept this work because you're now frequently bored at work with\n   your work, working for you (so that you can drive while you drive). \n * In roughly a year, your company will misunderstand what you're  good at, and\n   will now change your job to primarily helping others on your team with their\n   work. However, this proves to be difficult, because some people that you work\n   with have a different skill-set, and would probably be a lot better at\n   management/training/and supervision than you.\n * As it's currently impossible to optimize people (which isn't to say that\n   Silicon Valley isn't trying), you'll stay at this position even if you can\n   move up because with one more promotion, you won't be working with data\n   anymore.\n\nSo, now that we're in the right headspace, let's continue speeding this process\nalong, shall we? \n\nWhen we last left off, you're now capable of solving the vast majority of Excel\nissues using some combination of IFs, ANDs, ORs, Indexes, and Pivots (and for\nthose situations where you haven't solved the issue, you can always Spackle over\nit with =iferror(X,\"N/A\")   (which will simply fill a cell with the phrase \"N/A\"\nif there's an error...which lets you continue summarizing values in a column,\neven if some of them are erroneous. This is called \"throwing an error\"). Now\nwe're going into some cool features that you wouldn't know existed until someone\ntold you.\n\nSo for the first of these case studies, we'll explore the often neglected\n\"design\" tab on the pivot table window, as shown below (hey look, I can embed\nimages now!)\n\nTo get here, first create a pivot table, then populate the columns with some\ninformation. With the pivot table menu still open, you'll realize that the\nheader changes to include two new tabs: Analyze and Design. \n\nOnce choosing design, check out the left-hand side, the real power begins on\n\"report layout\". You'll notice that pivot tables generally stack row information\non top of each other, which great for readability, but not much else. As such,\nif you click the report layout button, and choose \"tabular format\", it'll\nrearrange your data so that the values turn into columns...however, it currently\nlooks like hot garbage, as you can see here:\n\nThat's where the other design buttons come in.\n\nFirst, click the subtotals box, then \"do not show subtotals\" (you can also\nchange where the subtotals are located if you still want em). You can see the\nresults here:\n\nThe final step if to click the report layout button yet again, and click \"repeat\nall item labels\", this gives you something magical: \n\nYep, that's right, we essentially created the original data source from the\npivot table. While this isn't useful in and of itself (and there's actually an\neven easier way to do that), pivot tables can be very quickly reconfigured, and\nin this format, it allows you to work other excel magic (like index matches and\nIF statements), and you can get really tricky by copying the entire pivot table,\nand configuring it differently...matching it against itself.
