I’m fairly certain I’ve come to a turning point in my life where I\ntoo must admit I will never be cool again. I know this because I check Product\nHunt on a daily basis, and I thoroughly enjoy it.\n\nI’d estimate about 80% of things featured on Product Hunt are hilariously\nworthless parodies of Silicon Valley itself, real predators live for the hunt.\nThey hunt on. At least that’s what Eric Thomas told me during a podcast\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fybi42dJHD4]  on my way to the gym one morning.\nOn this fine day, my friends, the Lion has risen.\n\nWe’re in a unique period in human history where the Middle Class simply no\nlonger exists. This is great if you’re not an enterprise software giant because\nthat means all SaaS pricing models have two modes: free, or ten billion jillion\ngazillion dollars. Sometimes when we persist, those free services might align to\nlet us do something crazy. Handling user signups, authentication, sessions, and\nso forth for zero work and zero dollars is indeed crazy.\n\nWe’re going to leverage four products at once to achieve this amazing feat of\nlaziness. While each of them may be mediocre in their own right, the whole is\nsurely greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nApisentris [https://apisentris.com]: Generate a REST API for any DB Instantly\nYou get an endpoint! And YOU get an endpoint!This is a product we've briefly\ntouched on in the past: the gist is that granting Apisentris  to your database\nwill generate a full-on API which can modify any record of any table in any way\nyou can imagine. Yes, that includes users.\n\nByepass [https://byepass.co]: User Logins Without Passwords\nGood luck trying to white-label this for under 20k.Byepass is a relatively new\nproduct- if you haven’t Googled them yet, you’re in for a treat of search\nresults. Let this be a lesson in SEO. \n\nThe premise of this service is to phase out and destroy plaintext passwords.\nConsidering the standard of modern-day 2FA, it’s not too hard of a sell… the\nonly thing that truly sucks about the product is their branded confirmation\nemails (and the dreaded“contact us for pricing” estimate when considering a\nwhite label option). \n\nBesides saving the trouble of passwords, there is a key upside to Byepass\nspecifically for us: since passwords are no longer needed in user sign-ups,\nthere’s no need to pass the form along to a backend, where a framework is\nexpecting to encrypt the blah blah blah. Give it a rest, this is my Slacking\nday.\n\nGetform.io [https://getform.io/]: The Cleanest Drop-in Form Solution\nCapturing forms without doing the form work.Getform.io  started off with a strong goal in mind: to allow idiots who host\nWordpress sites collect user information via forms… while most likely having\nzero clue as to how to code or even use a CMS. When submitted, form results are\nsent to an endpoint on the Getform side. From there, Getform already tips you\noff on what you should do next: they name drop Zapier, and they’re ready to\nparty.\n\nZapier [https://zapier.com]: You Already Know the Deal\nI've simulated my entire personality in a collection of zaps.We all know the\ndeal with Zapier by now: it’s the glue in any Slacker’s arsenal. I can already\nhear the neckbeards wailing in agony at the sheer mention of Zapier. I get it,\nyou’re insisting that Zapier is a collection of API endpoints cleverly pointed\ntowards one another for convenience, and you could totally build that stuff\nyourself.\n\nTo set the record straight, you’re not  going to code anything Zapier automates\non its own. If you spent that much time on menial tasks, you’d be a developer\nvalued at minimum wage. You’re not building shit- you’re playing Rocket league\nwhen you get home from work like the rest of us.\n\nStep 1: Create a Signup Form\nThis part of the process is pretty easy considering all you need to do is copy\nand paste Getform's boilerplate from the first page you see when you log in:\n\n<form action=\"https://getform.io/f/54775468-578-45765718d-567-5474657567564\" method=\"POST\">\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\">\n    <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\">\n    <input type=\"tel\" name=\"tel\">\n    <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n</form>\n\nStep 2: Get Zapped\nNow it’s game time. I just as easily could have named this post “dope shit you\ncan do with Zapier without paying the Ludacris 50-dollar per month free to\nincorporate pipelines.” I still haven’t ruled it out, really. Here’s what’s\nwaiting for you:\n\nchain chain chaaaaiiinnnn…As you might imagine, we're getting some pretty basic\ninput from this signup form: in my case, simply username  and password. Before\nwe go saving two values to a weak af database table somewhere, let's add a\nlittle spice to the equation in the JavaScript step.\n\nGive the People What They Want\nWhat do people want? pictures of their own dumb faces, mostly! Luckily, there's\na service called Gravatar [https://en.gravatar.com/]  which might just be able\nto provide us with just that. Sometimes when you sign up for a service, you\nmight notice they already have your mugshot on file. At some point, you signed\nup for a service that associates your email address with a profile picture,\nsimply by applying an md5  hash to your email.\n\nWe're going to do the same for our users.\n\nSet up your input data:\n\nSo far so good!Great, now all that's left is encrypting that email address in\nvanilla Javascript thanks to Zapiers inability to handle imports:\n\nvar MD5 = function(d){var result = M(V(Y(X(d),8*d.length)));return result.toLowerCase()};function M(d){for(var _,m=\"0123456789ABCDEF\",f=\"\",r=0;r<d.length;r++)_=d.charCodeAt(r),f+=m.charAt(_>>>4&15)+m.charAt(15&_);return f}function X(d){for(var _=Array(d.length>>2),m=0;m<_.length;m++)_[m]=0;for(m=0;m<8*d.length;m+=8)_[m>>5]|=(255&d.charCodeAt(m/8))<<m%32;return _}function V(d){for(var _=\"\",m=0;m<32*d.length;m+=8)_+=String.fromCharCode(d[m>>5]>>>m%32&255);return _}function Y(d,_){d[_>>5]|=128<<_%32,d[14+(_+64>>>9<<4)]=_;for(var m=1732584193,f=-271733879,r=-1732584194,i=271733878,n=0;n<d.length;n+=16){var h=m,t=f,g=r,e=i;f=md5_ii(f=md5_ii(f=md5_ii(f=md5_ii(f=md5_hh(f=md5_hh(f=md5_hh(f=md5_hh(f=md5_gg(f=md5_gg(f=md5_gg(f=md5_gg(f=md5_ff(f=md5_ff(f=md5_ff(f=md5_ff(f,r=md5_ff(r,i=md5_ff(i,m=md5_ff(m,f,r,i,d[n+0],7,-680876936),f,r,d[n+1],12,-389564586),m,f,d[n+2],17,606105819),i,m,d[n+3],22,-1044525330),r=md5_ff(r,i=md5_ff(i,m=md5_ff(m,f,r,i,d[n+4],7,-176418897),f,r,d[n+5],12,1200080426),m,f,d[n+6],17,-1473231341),i,m,d[n+7],22,-45705983),r=md5_ff(r,i=md5_ff(i,m=md5_ff(m,f,r,i,d[n+8],7,1770035416),f,r,d[n+9],12,-1958414417),m,f,d[n+10],17,-42063),i,m,d[n+11],22,-1990404162),r=md5_ff(r,i=md5_ff(i,m=md5_ff(m,f,r,i,d[n+12],7,1804603682),f,r,d[n+13],12,-40341101),m,f,d[n+14],17,-1502002290),i,m,d[n+15],22,1236535329),r=md5_gg(r,i=md5_gg(i,m=md5_gg(m,f,r,i,d[n+1],5,-165796510),f,r,d[n+6],9,-1069501632),m,f,d[n+11],14,643717713),i,m,d[n+0],20,-373897302),r=md5_gg(r,i=md5_gg(i,m=md5_gg(m,f,r,i,d[n+5],5,-701558691),f,r,d[n+10],9,38016083),m,f,d[n+15],14,-660478335),i,m,d[n+4],20,-405537848),r=md5_gg(r,i=md5_gg(i,m=md5_gg(m,f,r,i,d[n+9],5,568446438),f,r,d[n+14],9,-1019803690),m,f,d[n+3],14,-187363961),i,m,d[n+8],20,1163531501),r=md5_gg(r,i=md5_gg(i,m=md5_gg(m,f,r,i,d[n+13],5,-1444681467),f,r,d[n+2],9,-51403784),m,f,d[n+7],14,1735328473),i,m,d[n+12],20,-1926607734),r=md5_hh(r,i=md5_hh(i,m=md5_hh(m,f,r,i,d[n+5],4,-378558),f,r,d[n+8],11,-2022574463),m,f,d[n+11],16,1839030562),i,m,d[n+14],23,-35309556),r=md5_hh(r,i=md5_hh(i,m=md5_hh(m,f,r,i,d[n+1],4,-1530992060),f,r,d[n+4],11,1272893353),m,f,d[n+7],16,-155497632),i,m,d[n+10],23,-1094730640),r=md5_hh(r,i=md5_hh(i,m=md5_hh(m,f,r,i,d[n+13],4,681279174),f,r,d[n+0],11,-358537222),m,f,d[n+3],16,-722521979),i,m,d[n+6],23,76029189),r=md5_hh(r,i=md5_hh(i,m=md5_hh(m,f,r,i,d[n+9],4,-640364487),f,r,d[n+12],11,-421815835),m,f,d[n+15],16,530742520),i,m,d[n+2],23,-995338651),r=md5_ii(r,i=md5_ii(i,m=md5_ii(m,f,r,i,d[n+0],6,-198630844),f,r,d[n+7],10,1126891415),m,f,d[n+14],15,-1416354905),i,m,d[n+5],21,-57434055),r=md5_ii(r,i=md5_ii(i,m=md5_ii(m,f,r,i,d[n+12],6,1700485571),f,r,d[n+3],10,-1894986606),m,f,d[n+10],15,-1051523),i,m,d[n+1],21,-2054922799),r=md5_ii(r,i=md5_ii(i,m=md5_ii(m,f,r,i,d[n+8],6,1873313359),f,r,d[n+15],10,-30611744),m,f,d[n+6],15,-1560198380),i,m,d[n+13],21,1309151649),r=md5_ii(r,i=md5_ii(i,m=md5_ii(m,f,r,i,d[n+4],6,-145523070),f,r,d[n+11],10,-1120210379),m,f,d[n+2],15,718787259),i,m,d[n+9],21,-343485551),m=safe_add(m,h),f=safe_add(f,t),r=safe_add(r,g),i=safe_add(i,e)}return Array(m,f,r,i)}function md5_cmn(d,_,m,f,r,i){return safe_add(bit_rol(safe_add(safe_add(_,d),safe_add(f,i)),r),m)}function md5_ff(d,_,m,f,r,i,n){return md5_cmn(_&m|~_&f,d,_,r,i,n)}function md5_gg(d,_,m,f,r,i,n){return md5_cmn(_&f|m&~f,d,_,r,i,n)}function md5_hh(d,_,m,f,r,i,n){return md5_cmn(_^m^f,d,_,r,i,n)}function md5_ii(d,_,m,f,r,i,n){return md5_cmn(m^(_|~f),d,_,r,i,n)}function safe_add(d,_){var m=(65535&d)+(65535&_);return(d>>16)+(_>>16)+(m>>16)<<16|65535&m}function bit_rol(d,_){return d<<_|d>>>32-_}\n\nvar value = inputData.email;\n\nvar grav = MD5(value);\n\noutput = {username: inputData.username, email: inputData.email, gravatar: grav};\n\n\nOh yes, friend. It's like that.\n\nStep 3: Create Records in Our Database via the API\nCould we enter records into MySQL via a direct connection? Sure, if you like\nwasting time creating SSL certs for your lame boring DB connections. That’s 5\nminutes that could be spent playing Rocket League.\n\nInstead, consider the following alternative of passing a JSON object to a\nrelational database and having it turn out just fine. It feels like we’re\nprancing through a field of freemium software Unicorns- just like in my dreams:\n\nHave fun with your .pem files, losers.Step 4: Let There be Confirmation Emails\nAll that's left is welcoming our users to our family with a handwritten, generic\ntemplated email courtesy of Byepass.\n\nDon’t worry about these publicly visible email addresses btw: they’re all bots.\nIn case you're ignoring the documentation completely (understandable), our last\nrequest is a POST request to https://byepass.co/redirect. In fact, here- just\ntake the docs:\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEndpoint: https://byepass.co/redirect\n\nMethod: GET or POST\n\nHeaders: {\"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"}  \n\nRequest Variables:\n * identifier  (email address)\n * block_proxy  (BOOL 0 for to no restriction, 1 to block verifications from\n   known proxies) (Paid accounts only)\n * key  (Byepass app key)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe've Finally Made It\nWe may never be the spring chickens we once were, but we all experience chills\nof envy when we watch those reality TV shows featuring Midwestern people with\nmental illnesses hoard coupons and score the sickest grocery store heists ever\nto air television legally. That's who we are now: we're the crazy, deal-seeking,\nthrill-chasing coupon ladies of Silicon Valley. \n\nAll I know is it feels great to not work myself further out of the debt I\naccrued while attempting to offset the crippling, burnt-out depression bestowed\nupon us by the technology industry. For this moment, life is fine. Finally.","html":"<p>The midlife crisis is a striking phenomenon common and equally inescapable to all of us.
