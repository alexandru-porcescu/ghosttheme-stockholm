I don't like spending hours of my time cleaning data to\nbe rewarded with a shitty iframe embed: I want my data. As we've already seen by\nexposing Tableau's hidden Superadmin access\n[\thttps://hackersandslackers.com/hacking-linux-tableu-server/], it's pretty\nclear Tableau doesn't want you to do this. \n\nI realize Tableau is a BI tool, and some might argue we're barking up the wrong\ntree, and all data should be clean before reaching Tableau. My sentiment is\nthis: fuck that. If a single license costs one thousand dollars, and we have the\npower to manipulate data faster  as we visualize it, we should at least be able\nto own  that data: and by \"own,\" I don't mean a CSV export. I want it in my own \ndatabase of choice, not a locked down and hidden Postgres database living on a\nVPS filled with Tableau stuff.\n\nHere's how we'd do that.\n\n\"You Expect us to Just Walk out the Casino with Millions of Dollars on us?\"\nYou're looking at a Boeski, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros and a Leon\nSpinks, not to mention the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever.You're here because\nyou're the best of the best. If you're feeling scared, feel free to back out\nnow.\n\nThis tutorial assumes you have a Tableau Server instance, with a workbook\npublished to a site within said instance. We're going to take a page out of that\nworkbook and turn the raw data into a database table. FAIR  WARNING: We're about\nto dive deep into the obscure world of the Tableau Server REST API\n[https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_ref.htm]\n. It's clunky, it's ugly, and it returns XML. Strap yourself in. \n\nWe're going to be working with 3 core endpoints. Let's walk through them, and\nI'll show you how to exploit said endpoints to create a ruthless data mining\nmachine in Python.\n\n'Tableau Authorization' Endpoint\nLike all obnoxious (aka useful) APIs, we need to authorize each API call with a\ntemporary token. Of course, we'll just have Python generate said token for every\ncall we make.\n\nPOST: http://[MyTaleauServerURL]/api/3.0/auth/signin\n\nHitting this endpoint successfully will result in an XML response (ugh). The\nresponse should look something like this:\n\n<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>\n<tsResponse xmlns=\"http://tableau.com/api\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://tableau.com/api http://tableau.com/api/ts-api-3.0.xsd\">\n    <credentials token=\"KBIuvu6FTViuyivuTUR^yfvgTUycvjGubgc\">\n        <site id=\"09Hiugv-345-45d0-b48b-34543giuyvg\" contentUrl=\"hackers\"/>\n        <user id=\"Uohiiyu-3455-8675-9b42-bugvdr876gv\"/>\n    </credentials>\n</tsResponse>\n\n\nThere are a number of things going on here that we should take note of. The\nfirst being a marvel of modern technology: this is perhaps the shittiest\nresponse to a token API call in modern history. Other than that, we need two\nthings from this response:\n\n * The token  is required for every API call from here on out. It is intended to\n   be passed as a header value with the key X-Tableau-Auth.\n * The site ID  is what we'll be using to look up the location of our workbooks\n   in our server instance. This is added to the URL of future API calls (again,\n   impressively shitty design here).\n\n'List All Views by Site' Endpoint\nThere are actually a number of methods we could use to retrieve views, but we're\nspecifically settling on listing our views by 'site,' in the Tableau sense of\nthe word. If you're unfamiliar, a Tableau site  is not a site at all: it's more\nof project within a greater Tableau instance. They probably should've named them\nthat.\n\nGET: http://[MyTaleauServerURL]/api/3.0/sites/[MySiteID]/views\n\nAs mentioned, we use the site ID  from step 1 to construct this endpoint. In my\nparticular instance, I've only saved a single workbook for simplicity's sake.\nThe response for such a case is as follows:\n\n<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>\n<tsResponse xmlns=\"http://tableau.com/api\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://tableau.com/api http://tableau.com/api/ts-api-3.0.xsd\">\n    <pagination pageNumber=\"1\" pageSize=\"100\" totalAvailable=\"1\"/>\n    <views>\n        <view id=\"9a4a1de9-b7af-4a4a-8556-fd5ac82f92bd\" name=\"Jira\" contentUrl=\"JiraIssues/sheets/Jira\" createdAt=\"2018-12-21T09:11:39Z\" updatedAt=\"2018-12-21T09:11:39Z\">\n            <workbook id=\"208a0c4e-e1d9-4852-9d19-7a2fe2717191\"/>\n            <owner id=\"Uohiiyu-3455-8675-9b42-bugvdr876gv\"/>\n            <project id=\"4d1ca337-20b4-442c-aa7b-1dfd470b68bd\"/>\n            <tags/>\n        </view>\n    </views>\n</tsResponse>\n\n\nCheck out the views  node: when we make this API call, <views>  will contain a\nlist of every view saved to the specified site. Keep in mind that a view is\nequivalent to a \"sheet\" of a workbook: in almost any case, you will have many\nviews listed here. \n\nMy sheet happens to be called \"Jira,\" as stated by name=\"Jira\". The thing we\nreally need however is the view id attribute: this will be used in our third and\nfinal API call.\n\n'Get View Data' Endpoint\nNow let's get the raw data from a view of our choice.\n\nGET: http://[MyTaleauServerURL]/api/3.0/sites/[MySiteID]/views/[MyViewID]/data\n\n\nHere's where we hit pay dirt. This request will result in an output of\ncomma-separated values; I don't need to tell you what we can do with\ncomma-separated values. Here's what my response looks like after formatting it\nas a table:\n\nCurrent AssigneeCurrent StatusDay of Updatedepic_colorepic_nameIssue Type\nissuetype_colorissuetype_urlkeyPriorityprojectsummaryTodd BirchardDoneJune 7,\n2018#42526EWidgetsBug#db5d5dhttps://hackers.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/bug.png\nHACK-96LowestHackers and Slackers\"Recent Posts\" widget does not have link\nrolloverTodd BirchardBacklogJune 15, 2018#57D9A3Page TemplatesTask#73B0E1\nhttps://hackers.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/task.pngHACK-32LowestHackers and\nSlackers“Join” pageTodd BirchardDoneNovember 13, 2018#42526EWidgetsTask#73B0E1\nhttps://hackers.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/task.pngHACK-543MediumHackers and\nSlackersAdd “pro tip” boxTodd BirchardTo DoDecember 14, 2018#679EEFSEOMajor\nFunctionality#93d171https://hackers.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/story.png\nHACK-656LowHackers and SlackersAdd alt attributes to images vis clarifai Todd\nBirchardBacklogOctober 16, 2018#FDDA3EAccountsMajor Functionality#93d171\nhttps://hackers.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/story.pngHACK-473MediumHackers and\nSlackersAdd avatar selection to signupTodd BirchardDoneNovember 13, 2018#57D9A3\nPage TemplatesSub-task#92BFE5\nhttps://hackers.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/subtask.pngHACK-231MediumHackers and\nSlackersAdd blurb to each post page explaining what these areTodd BirchardDone\nDecember 10, 2018#291BA9Code snippetsTask#73B0E1\nhttps://hackers.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/task.pngHACK-452MediumHackers and\nSlackersAdd color styles for json snippetsThat's right, a table.

We don't want to steal a single view, we\nwant to systematically rob Tableau of it's views on a scheduler and Shanghai\nthem off to a database of our choosing.\n\nIt would be a crime not to automate this, so I've created a class containing all\nthe relevant methods we'd want when it comes to interacting with Tableau's REST\nAPI:\n\nimport requests\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\nfrom . import r\nimport pandas as pd\nimport io\n\n\nclass ExtractTableauView:\n    \"\"\"Class for with the Tableau server API.\"\"\"\n\n    __baseurl = r.get('baseurl')\n    __username = r.get('username')\n    __password = r.get('password')\n    __database = r.get('uri')\n    __contenturl = r.get('contenturl')\n\n    @classmethod\n    def get_view(cls, site, xml, view, token):\n        \"\"\"Extract contents of a single view.\"\"\"\n        headers = {'X-Tableau-Auth': token,\n                   'Content-Type': 'text/csv'\n                   }\n        req = requests.get(cls.__baseurl + '/api/3.2/sites/' + str(site) +'/views/' + str(view) + '/data', headers=headers, stream=True)\n        csv_text = req.text\n        view_df = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(csv_text), header=0)\n        return view_df\n\n    @classmethod\n    def list_views(cls, site, xml, token):\n        \"\"\"List all views belonging to a Tableau Site.\"\"\"\n        headers = {'X-Tableau-Auth': token}\n        req = requests.get(cls.__baseurl + '/api/3.2/sites/' + site + '/views', auth=(cls.__username, cls.__password), headers=headers)\n        root = ET.fromstring(req.content)\n        views_arr = []\n        for child in root.iter('*'):\n            if child.tag == '{http://tableau.com/api}views':\n                for view in child:\n                    view_dict = {\n                        'name': view.attrib.get('name'),\n                        'id': view.attrib.get('id'),\n                        'url': cls.__baseurl + '/' + view.attrib.get('contentUrl'),\n                        'created': view.attrib.get('createdAt'),\n                        'updated': view.attrib.get('updatedAt')\n                    }\n                    views_arr.append(view_dict)\n        return views_arr\n\n    @classmethod\n    def get_token(cls, xml):\n        \"\"\"Receive Auth token to perform API requests.\"\"\"\n        for child in xml.iter('*'):\n            if child.tag == '{http://tableau.com/api}credentials':\n                token = child.attrib.get('token')\n                return token\n\n    @classmethod\n    def get_site(cls, xml):\n        \"\"\"Retrieve ID of Tableau 'site' instance.\"\"\"\n        root = xml\n        for child in root.iter('*'):\n            if child.tag == '{http://tableau.com/api}site':\n                site = child.attrib.get('id')\n                return site\n\n    @classmethod\n    def initialize_tableau_request(cls):\n        \"\"\"Retrieve core XML for interacting with Tableau.\"\"\"\n        headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/xml'}\n        body = '<tsRequest><credentials name=\"' + cls.__username + '\" password=\"' + cls.__password + '\" ><site contentUrl=\"' + cls.__contenturl + '\" /></credentials></tsRequest>'\n        req = requests.post(cls.__baseurl + '/api/3.2/auth/signin', auth=(cls.__username, cls.__password), headers=headers, data=body)\n        root = ET.fromstring(req.content)\n        return root\n\n\nThe above snippet is a Python class utilizing all the API endpoints we explored\nin a mostly effortless manner. Instantiating the class immediately covers the\ngrunt work of:\n\n *   Generating a token\n * Getting your (unfriendly) site ID\n * Listing all views belonging to the provided site\n * Retrieving data from a worksheet of choice\n\nGet a list of views in your Tableau site by using the list_views()  method. When\nyou see the view you want, pass the view ID  to the .get_view()  method. This\nwill result in response of all raw data in the view in the form of a CSV. \n\nHow to Pull a Heist (Final Chapter): Storing in Offshore Accounts\nTo earn your title as a true con artist, I'm leaving the final step up to you.\nYou've escaped with the loot, but you'll need to put all that data somewhere.\nThis should be a trivial matter of automating a simple database query, but the\nspecifics are up to you.\n\nIf you're ready to liberate your data, feel free to grab the source off of\nGithub [https://gist.github.com/toddbirchard/ad1386b4334e7b22b2f7b38edca3bd5c] \nand go nuts.","html":"<p>There's nothing I love more than exposing expensive enterprise software. </p><p>It may not seem obvious, but most SaaS products have an underlying core goal: shackle businesses to depend on proprietary, closed-source, costly software.
