If you've been following along, you've\nlearned how to use basically every tool that an Excel analyst would need to have\nin the front of their minds. For those just joining us, these tools are as\nfollows: \n\n * Pivot Tables (both the report layout and the tabular layout)\n * Lookup Functions\n * IF + AND + OR statements \n * And the combination of these three tools (and if you're particularly\n   efficient, you may have dabbled in some VBA here and there)\n\nHowever, if you have functioning vision (and once you've generated 10,000 hours\nworth of pivot tables and lookups...you may not need to see anymore), you may\nnotice that Excel has about 20,000 more buttons that you've never interacted\nwith! Any reasonable individual would assume that you must be missing\nsomething...but we're not reasonable...we're ANALYSTS. \n\nTo solve this puzzle, I ask you to think back to our discussion on databases,\nand how they quickly grow unwieldy: deleting code will often cause significantly\nmore problems than just leaving the code in there and hoping no one wants to use\nit (have you ever glitched through a wall while playing a video-game only to see\na half designed level...that's something that the dev team didn't have time to\nfinish!)\n\nOne thing to remember is that the proto-version of Excel was one of the very\nfirst programs available on the personal computer (that would be VisiCalc for\nthe Apple II if you're the type of person who's into esoteric computer trivia)\nand it revolutionized the world...of accounting. After Windows overtook Apple in\nthe PC department, Excel soon followed, and because it was the only game in\ntown, it needed to do any calculation related task that the user-base (which at\nthis time didn't include everyone) came up with. \n\nIf you've ever taken a computer programming class, this may sound familiar, in\nthat it's the exact same design methodology as the programming language Java.\nJava was designed so that you could code ANYTHING on it and it would run on ANY\nplatform. However, the downside of this is that with the exception of a small\nset of things that Java does pretty well, coding in Java quickly gets miserable,\nit's slow as molasses, and in case you haven't noticed, your Java applet needs\nto update whenever anyone in the world thinks of a new idea (seriously, check\nthe lower right hand corner of your screen, an update is pending right now!)\n\nSo now that this entertaining history lesson is over, let's leverage a few of\nthose tools that our ancestors left us in order to make our (or more\nimportantly, an end-user's) life easier. \n\nThe first of these functions that I care to talk about is the \"naming of\nranges\". Back in the day, Excel wouldn't let you open up two workbooks at the\nsame time, making it difficult and annoying to lookup between worksheets\n(granted, I'd argue that best practice is that if you're planning on leaving\nthose formulas on your worksheet, that you paste the source data into a new\nworksheet in your workbook or risk the breaking of your links). In order to make\nboth inter and intra worksheet lookups and formulas easier, Excel offers the\nability to \"name\" a particular range (or \"collection of cells\"...the concept of\na range becomes much more important if you're coding VBA). For example, here I\nhave a list of random names: \n\nTotally Random NamesNow, if I were to write a formula that would involve these\nnames (such as finding out where DMX is hiding) I would probably just use the\nlocation of the range (A:A, or $A$2:$A$8 if you're an absolute kinda person).\nHOWEVER, I can also bless this column with a name.   \n\nTo do this, highlight the row or column, click formulas up top, and then go to\n\"Define Name\"\n\nNaming a RangeThe interface automatically takes the first cell and assumes that\nyou want it to be the name of the range (NO SPACES!) but I like to keep things\nto a single word, so let's call this \"Names\", and hit OK. \n\nWhat you've now done is transformed anything in column A on sheet 1 of this\nworkbook into a monolith known as \"Names\". While this sounds unimpressive on\nit's own (what is a name?) it comes in handy in two ways. \n\n1) If you're ever writing a formula that refers to column A, you can now just\ntype \"Names\" instead, no matter what sheet the formula starts in, as long as\nit's in the workbook (which saves you a ton of time, and makes it so that you\ndon't need to click back to sheet 1 to select column A or to type 'Sheet 1!'A:A\nwhich you'll almost certainly screw up (In fact, that's probably wrong). For\nexample, let's create a bunch of extra sheets to complicate things, and then try\nand find DMX. \n\nThe real question is...what IS he going to give you?The utility there is pretty\nevident, however, there's an even more useful reason for naming a range, and it\ninvolves another one of Excel's functions...the active-X controls. Plopping\nthese controls into a workbook allows someone who calls tech support when their\ncomputer crashes to read your data...and as such, represent an important albeit\nun-enjoyable part of the job. \n\nTo drop one of these into your worksheet, first go to developer (which, as a\nperson who's made it this far, I assume you've enabled), then insert (the cool\ninsert, not the one for pleebs), and then active-X control (I generally use the\ncombo box...and no, I don't know what it's a combination of). Check it out: \n\nIf your coworker doesn't have developer mode in their ribbon, RunYou'll then be\nasked to \"draw\" the box, generally you want it to be roughly the size of two or\nthree cells. Once that's done, it'll give you a seemingly normal drop-down box,\nbut now, let's click properties to see where the magic happens. \n\nSeen here: MagicNow, if you're interested, you can look up what all this stuff\nmeans, but for most people, the only things that matter are: List Fill Range,\nand  maybe linked cell.\n\nThe list fill range should be populated with what you want the drop-down to say,\nand because you already named a range...all you gotta do is type that in, and\nit'll gobble up anything you type into the range you defined. \n\nThe linked cell (above list fill range) is a cell that you want to export the\ndata from this cell into so that it can be interacted with by regular Excel\nstuff (like formulae), the cool kids will put that underneath the combo box so\nyou can't see it, but for the sake of clarity, I'll show you how this works (the\nlinked cell is G2):\n\nFirst X out of the properties window, then un-click \"design mode\"\n\nThe list fillThe linked cellAs an added bonus, you can type in the first few\nletters of one of those names, and it'll auto-populate. \n\nThe coup-de-grace is that you can now name cell G2 and you've essentially\ncreated a dynamic variable that someone can choose that can be shoved into\nformulae...and I hope you can see how this might be useful if you were building\nsay...a report that checks the values associated with a particular name or ID\n(and you want to gently nudge someone reading your data into selecting only the\nvalues you have data for). \n\nCongrats, you're now a step closer to sharing the fruit of your knowledge with\nthe populace...and by using these tools, you don't need to share that knowledge\nwith the very same populace (they won't be paying attention anyways), and that\nmy friend, is how the world goes round. \n\n-Snactive-X","html":"<p>Hi there dear reader, we've now reached a crossroads in your ability to use Excel as a means of data analysis.
