If you've been reading along throughout this journey,\nyou'll realize that all of my posts have something in common (other than\nExcel...smartass), they all assume that you're already working with data...even\nif it's just cursory exposure. Well, every journey of a thousand worksheets\nbegins with a single lookup, and hopefully this story will help you position\nyourself to inner-join the fraternity of functions. \n\nFor the two of you who went out of the way to read our bios, you may have seen\nsomething interesting: I started out as a therapist...a job that does everything\nit can to avoid using hard data. You see, every clinician, no matter the\ndiscipline will tell you: \n\n1) The amount of paperwork that they need to complete is absolutely mind\nboggling (in fact, I had more paperwork doing mental health counseling than I've\never had at my desk job...which is almost entirely paperwork).\n2) Clinicians will do anything within their power to avoid doing said paperwork.\n3) They hate their electronic medical records (not their particular program, but\nthe very idea of having a system which makes things easier to track). \n\nThe issue with this Trifecta is that clinicians are paid and audited based on\ntheir notes, and as such, they've come up with the saying: \"If you didn't write\nit, it didn't happen\". With that being said, at every single clinical position\nI've ever held, I became the expert on our computer systems, as since I was\nyoung, I've always loved computers. As time went on, troubleshooting (or, let's\nbe honest...just explaining over and over again to deaf ears) computer issues\nbecame one of my essential job duties. After \"doing computers\" became a fact of\nlife, I was given access to our EMR's back-end (that is, where the data lives,\nas opposed to the front-end, which is what the user interacts with). \n\nUpon viewing this back-end data, I was ASTOUNDED with how inefficient our\nnotation was. Despite the fact that almost every clinician complained about\nhaving to do all their notes (and assessments), they were going out of their way \n to make documentation a more arduous process. It was at this moment that my\norigin story began, fixing these issues was akin to my parents being shot in\nfront of me by Joe Chill. \n\nOne thing to note is that at this time, I had never even opened Excel (that's\nhow disengaged the clinical world was from the \"business\" world), and I only had\na cursory understanding of databases and spreadsheets, stemming from an AP\ncomputer science course that I took in High School (shout out to the rest of the\nBrooklyn Technites!), and to give you an idea of the time frame here, I was a\nyear and change out of graduate school. Unfortunately, as I hear far too often,\nI was the victim of a string of horrifically bad math teachers that scared me\naway from anything that had to do with numbers all throughout college\n(interestingly, Greek letters I was just fine with...at the time, my brain\ndidn't connect that physics and inorganic chemistry were math), so I made it all\nthe way through grad school without ever taking a math class, let alone calculus\n(AP comp sci counts for an entire year of math...why I still thought I was bad\nat math now seems like lunacy).\n\nUntil, one faithful day I was given an interesting assignment at the very end of\nthe day: I could use our EMR to run a report that included every patient we had\nthat was given a specific test, but we needed a list of everyone who lacked this\nparticular test. I told my company (which as far as nonprofit clinical agencies\ngo, was actually fairly large) that I would see what I could do, and went home\nfor the day. \n\nThat night, I had DVR'ed the first season of Mr. Robot (I highly recommend\nseason 1), a show about a hacking. One thing I will say about the show is that\nit has quite possibly the ONLY realistic depiction of hacking in all of\nfiction...there's no warping into the machine to play a game of space invaders\nwhich unlocks the nastygram (read Batman vs. the Punisher to learn more about\nnastygrams), just the compiling of as much information as possible and then\nputting it all together, in fact, it illustrates that 90% of hacking is social\nengineering...which is why you should never give anyone your password (except\nme...of course). I then binged the entire first season that night, and realized\nthat I somehow understood the vast majority of the intricacies of the\nhack...almost like I spoke the same language. \n\nI came into the office the next day, and inspired by Mr. Robot, I asked a bunch\nof questions regarding the data that was available to us through the EMR, and I\nfound out that in addition to getting the list of people who had the test, I\ncould also get a list of everyone. Now, if another clinician got this far, they\nwould realize that with these two pieces of data, you could sort alphabetically\nand then just see manually who of the 12,000 people on one list weren't on the\nother, and that could probably have been a part time job for the rest of your\ndays, but I remembered the mission: Efficiency, of which to manually count was\nanathema. I then tried several search terms in google consisting of \"compare\"\nand \"list\" and after the second try, I found a tutorial for Vlookups (the irony\nof my exclusive use of index match when I have VLookup to thank for my future\ncareer isn't lost on me) and got to work. \n\nNow, with seasoned eyes, I realize that this is 12 seconds of work, write a\nquick index match and double click the lower  right corner of the cell) but at\nthis time I, and more importantly my company (comprised entirely of Luddites)\nfound it incredibly impressive and useful. \n\nImbued with a new sense of purpose, and the knowledge that I understood\ninstructions on the internet, I then began my quest to make things more\nefficient for my colleagues...billing it as \"if you use these tricks, you can\nsee your patients for longer\" (which by all means, is true). As trite as it is\nto say, I was honestly hoping to have the other clinicians work smarter...and\nnot harder. \n\n\nThroughout the course my my time as both the \"computer\" guy and a clinician, I\ninstituted a series of projects (think auto-populated note templates,\nproductivity trackers, and a nifty tool that showed you only the people who you\nhaven't seen in a given month so that you can call them), all of which I had the\ntime to do because I too was using these tools to make myself more efficient.\nOnce the time came when I had essentially automated my paperwork, my company\nbegan entrusting me with more data, and kept coming up with increasingly complex\nproblems to solve, until they realized that I was essentially building these\ntools full-time. It was at this point where I made the decision to ask if they\ncould build an analyst position for me that would allow me to see all of our\ndata, track it, trend it, and continue making new tools to help us hit our\nperformance goals (we in the biz call these Key Performance Indicators: KPIs),\nand they accepted and I moved into my first data analyst job. \n\n\nOnce I had roughly a year under my belt, I could now begin applying to jobs with\nthe data analyst skill-set (who knew that the first thing to come to mind when\nyou see \"Therapist\" isn't \"computer nerd!?) and indeed although I stayed in\nHealthcare, I moved onto companies that had more robust data needs, and more\ntools I could use to do the job, and that's where I am today...all because I was\ninspired by a morphine addicted sociopath who happened to also be a computer\nwhiz. \n\nSo, why did I take the time to write this story? Despite how cocky I can get,\neven I'm not at the level where I think strangers on the internet would want to\nread my life story. No, I'm writing this as a general template to how you can\nleverage any existing skill-set into a job working with data, by following a few\nsimple guidelines: \n\n\n1) Math isn't a skill, it's a way of thinking. Despite believing that math\nwasn't for me, after essentially doing \"math\" for the last decade or so I\nrealized that you don't need to be good at \"arithmetic\" (the actual solving of\nequations and rote calculation) in order to solve math problems, you just need\nto be the type of person who likes to find solutions and/or find flaws in\nthings. There's a reason that statistically, math majors make the best Lawyers:\nboth jobs are essentially about finding flaws, and patching over them (or using\nthem to your advantage). If you're the type of person who, instead of giving up\nwhen faced with a problem, you try to find a solution, you're a math\nperson...even if you don't know your times tables (like myself!).\n\n2) EVERY company can benefit from data, especially those that don't think they\nneed to. If your company doesn't have a data team, then they're straight up\nleaving money on the table in terms of exponential increases in efficiency. \n\n3) The corollary to number 2 is that the less a company utilizes data to their\nadvantage, the more impressive your small contribution will be. For example, I\nbuilt my entire career on being the only person in my company who knew how to do\na lookup (there were almost 5000 people at my company by the way). Use this to\nyour advantage. One thing that's great about data is that it allows you to\nDIRECTLY show how you're adding value to your company.\n\n4) This is perhaps the most important lesson I can impart on you (and indeed, I\nimpart it on my students as well...I'm still a counseling professor in my\ndowntime): It's impossible have all of the tools of a trade at your disposal at\nall times. One who has \"mastered\" their field (whatever their field may be)\nisn't the person who knows everything, it's the person who understands where to\nlook, and how to apply these instructions. No computer programmer knows all of\nthe functions and methods of a programming language off the top of their head,\nbut they do know how to read the documentation, similarly, a doctor doesn't have\nevery medication or condition memorized (at least, not after they've taken their\nStep-1) but they do know how to take test results and lookup the best cause of\naction . As such, when building your skills, focus on understanding the\ndocumentation, rather than trying to memorize all of the functions (because, as\nwe've already covered, there are about 20,000 that you'll never use).\n\nSo, with those four concepts in mind, if you've been wanting to take the data\nplunge, I implore you to identify and area within your company or team that you\nknow can be improved once the issue is identified, then be the person who\nidentifies the issue, and see if you can fix it. You never know, a chef that can\npivot out their ingredient list to cut costs and improve quality may be able to\nleverage that, and HR person can see the time to hire for particular positions\nand focus attention towards those jobs that are hard to fill, and even a\nstand-up comedian can quantify their laughs/joke and build their set that way. \n\nData is everywhere, you just need to learn to see it. \n\n- Snacksfuscious \n\nP.S. for my next post, I'm going to try something different. Did you know that\nby tweaking your computer a little bit, you can crunch numbers even faster? Next\ntime on Adventures in Excel: Hardware.","html":"<p>What's up data gang?
