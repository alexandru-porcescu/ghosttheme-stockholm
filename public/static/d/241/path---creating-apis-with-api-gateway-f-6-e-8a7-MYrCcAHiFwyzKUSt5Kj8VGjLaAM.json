We've also briefly covered\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/building-an-api-using-aws/]  the general concept\nbehind what Lambda functions. In case you've already forgotten, Lambdas are\nbasically just chunks of code in the cloud; think of them as tiny virtual\nservers, which have already been configured (and locked down) to serve one\nspecific purpose. Because that's literally what it is.\n\nThe data being stored in RDS is ultimately what we're targeting, and Lambdas \nserve as the in-between logic to serve up, modify, or add to the proper data.\nThe only piece missing from the picture is API Gateway. \n\nAs the name suggests, API Gateway  is the, uh, gateway  that users or systems\ninteract with to obtain what they're seeking. It is (hopefully) the only part of\nthis VPC structure an external user can interact with:\n\nSimple API to interact with RDS.Serving as a \"gateway\" is obviously what all\nAPIs so, but the term is also true in the sense that API Gateway  is completely\nconfigured via UI, thus engineers of any programming background can safely\nmodify endpoints, methods,  CORs  configurations, or any of the high-level API\nstructure without being locked into a programming language. API Gateway  is\ntherefore very much an enterprise-geared product: it lends itself to large teams\nand scaling. That said, if it were to be compared to building an API via a\nframework designed to do such things (such as Express or Flask) the experience\nis undoubtedly more clunky. The trade-off being made for speed is immediate\nvisibility, assurance, and a higher chance for collaboration.\n\nThe Challenge of Building a \"Well-Designed\" API\nGood APIs are premeditated. A complex API might accept multiple methods per\nendpoint, allow advanced filtering of results, or handle advanced\nAuthentication. Neither of us have the time to attempt covering all of those\nthings in detail, but I will  leave you with the knowledge that all these\nfeatures are very much possible.\n\nThe API Gateway  interface is where you'd get started. Let's blow through the\nworld's most inappropriately fast explanation of building APIs ever ,and check\nout the UI:\n\nIt ain't pretty, but it works. * Your APIs are listed on the left. You can create more than one, if you're\n   some sort of sadist.\n * The Resources pane is the full structure of your API. At the highest level,\n   'resources' refers to Endpoints,  which are the URLs your API will ultimately\n   expose.\n * Every Endpoint  can contain whichever Methods  you choose to associate with\n   them (GET, POST, PUT, etc). Even if they belong to the same endpoint, a POST\n   method could contain entirely unrelated logic from a PUT method: its your\n   responsibility to make sure your API design makes sense.\n * Finally, each Method has their expected Request and Response  structures\n   defined individually, which what the horribly designed box diagram is\n   attempting to explain on the right. The box on the left labeled CLIENT refers\n   to the requester, where the box on the right represents the triggered action.\n\nThis UI is your bread and butter. I hope you're strapped in, because walking\nthrough this interface is going to be hella boring for all of us.\n\nCreating a Method Request\nThe first step to creating an endpoint (let's say a GET endpoint) is to set the\nexpectation for what the user will send to us:\n\nAwe yea, authorization. 1. Authorization  allows you to restrict users from using your API unless they\n    follow your IAM policy.\n 2. Request Validator  lets you chose if you'd like this validation to happen\n    via the body, query string parameters, headers, or all of the above.\n 3. API Keys  are useful if you're creating an API to sell commercially or\n    enforce limited access. If your business model revolves around selling an\n    API, you can realistically do this.\n 4. Query String Parameters  are... actually forget it, you know this by now.\n 5. See above.\n 6. If preferred, the Request Body can be assigned a model,  which is\n    essentially a JSON schema. If a request is made to your endpoint which does\n    not match the request body model, it is a malformed request. We'll cover \n    models  in the advanced course, once somebody actually starts paying me to\n    write this stuff.\n\nMethod Execution: AKA \"What do we do with this?\"\nSet the game plan. 1. Integration Type  specifies which AWS service will be accepting or affected\n    by this request. The vast majority of the time, this will be Lambda. If\n    you're wondering why other AWS Services aren't present, this has been made\n    intentional over time as just about any AWS service you can interact with\n    will still need logic to do anything useful: you can't just shove a JSON\n    object in a database's face and expect to get results. Unless you're using\n    MongoDB or something.\n 2. Lambda Proxies  are generally a bad idea. They auto-format your Lambda's \n    request  and response  body to follow a very  specific structure, which is\n    presumably intended to help speed up or standardize development. The\n    downside is these structures are bloated and most likely contain useless\n    information. To get an idea of what these structures look like, check them\n    out here.\n 3. The Region  your Lambda hosted lives in.\n 4. Name of the Lamba Function  your request will be directed to.\n 5. Execution role  refers to the IAM role your Lambda policy will be a part of.\n    This is kind of an obnoxious concept, but your function has permissions as\n    though it were a user. This is presumably Amazon's way of thinking ahead to\n    extending human rights to robots.\n 6. Caller Credentials  refers to API keys, assuming you chose to use them. If\n    this is checked, the API will not be usable without an API key, thus making\n    it difficult to test\n 7. Credentials Cache  probably refers to expiring credentials or something, I'm\n    sure you'll figure it out.\n 8. Timeout  can be increased if you're dealing with an API call that takes a\n    lot of time to respond, such as occasions with heavy data sets.\n 9. URL Paths probably do something, I don't know. Who really cares?\n\nINTERMISSION: The Part Where Things Happen\nThe next step in the flow would be where the AWS service we selected to handle\nthe request would do its thing. We'll get into that next time.\n\nResponse Codes and Headers\nKeep it 200 baby. 1. While AWS provides users with standard error codes  and generic errors, you\n    can add your own specific error/success messages. Props to whoever puts in\n    the effort.\n 2. Header Mappings  are the headings returned with the response. For example,\n    this is where you might solve cross-domain issues via the \n    Access-Control-Allow-Origin  header.\n\n3. Mapping Templates  are the Content-Type  of the response returned, most\ncommonly application/json.\n\nMethod Response\nI almost never spend time hereThis step is a continuation of the previous step.\nI'm not entirely sure what the point in splitting this into two screens is, but\nI'm guessing its not important.\n\nReap Your Rewards\nAt long last, this brings us to the end of our journey. This is presumably where\n you've executed a successful AWS test or something. However, there's a final\nstep before you go live; deploying your API:\n\nDeploy your API to a live \"stage\" and retire.Next time we'll cover the logical,\nless boring part of writing actual code behind these endpoints.","html":"<p>In our last adventure, we ventured off to create our very own cloud <a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/setting-up-mysql-on-aws/\">database</a> by using Amazon's <strong>RDS</strong> service.
