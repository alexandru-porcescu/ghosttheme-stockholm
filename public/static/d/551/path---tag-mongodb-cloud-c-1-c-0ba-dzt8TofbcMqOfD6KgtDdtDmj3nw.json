After loudly broadcasting my own confusion and\nmediocre ability to actually implement an effective cloud via MongoDB Stitch, my\nineptitude has been answered with an early Christmas gift. \n\nMy incessant complaining gained some acknowledgement from a couple of folks over\nat MongoDB. Perhaps the timing is simply by chance, but since then I've begun\nnoticing something some subtleties in the Stitch documentation; namely that if\nyou look hard enough, some of it begins to make sense. Either way, I'm chalking\nthis one up as a Christmas Miracle.\n\nLet's Automate Stuff: More Webhooks, Less Labor\nTo demonstrate what building an end-to-end sexy feature looks like in MongoDB\nStitch, I'm going to borrow some help from some old friends: the team behind \nClarifai. \n\nClarifai is one of the early players in the field of what I'm sure we'll\ncreatively refer to as AI as a service. More specifically, they provide an API\nfor image recognition which returns impressive metadata simply by passing an\nimage URL. Best part is, unless you're abusing the shit out of 5000 requests per\nmonth, the API is essentially free:\n\nPredict\n Search\n Custom Model Training\n Add or Edit Input Images\n 5,000  free operations\n 5,000  free operations\n 5,000  free operations\n 5,000  free operations\n Pre-Built Models: \n$1.20 / 1,000  operations\n\nCustom Models:\n$3.20 / 1,000  operations\n$1.20 / 1,000  operations\n $1.20 / 1,000  operations\n $1.20 / 1,000  operations\n If we were to try to fit any more instances of the words \"AI\" and \"Cloud\" into\nthis post, things could quickly derail into a shitty  IBM Watson commercial.\n\n(PS: Blockchain.)\n\nStoring Our Clarifai API Key\nIf you're following along, hit up Clarifai [https://clarifai.com/]  to grab your\nAPI key, no strings attached.\n\nAnd no, nobody is paying me to me to write about their SaaS products.Copy and\npaste your brand new key and head over to the MongoDB Stitch Console\n[https://stitch.mongodb.com]. In our Stitch project, we're going to store our\nkey as a value (you might recall this as being a convenient way to store\nsecrets).\n\nCopy and paste your key as a string in a new value. The only catch is we'll be\nformatting our key as Key #####################, simply because this is the\nformat the API expects to receive when we pass our key as a header to the\nClarifai API.\n\nWarning: Mild Architecting Ahead\nBefore going too far into code, let's recap how this functionality will probably\nwork.\n\nIn our actual application, we'll be identifying images needing alt  tags (either\nvia frontend or backend logic). At that point, we should find the src  attribute\nof said <img>  tags and pass it to a Stitch function; preferably one that makes\na post request to Clarifai. \n\nThis is in fact too simple to be true, as there is one gotcha: Stitch functions \ncannot make http requests on their own. They can,  however, invoke Stitch \nWebhooks. These webhooks share nearly identical syntax and structure to \nfunctions, with a few exceptions:\n\n * Webhooks have endpoints (duh).\n * They have explicit inbound/outbound rules restricting what can invoke them.\n * There are options to set authorization via key or otherwise.\n\nWith all that in mind, our end-to-end flow will end up looking something like\nthis:\n\n 1. Our application identifies an image needing tags an invokes a serverless \n    function.\n 2. The function  constructs the body of the request we'll be making to Clarifai \n     with containing the URL of the image.\n 3. As crazy as it sounds, we then POST to a Stitch endpoint, which in turns\n    makes the actual  POST request to Clarifai. The request is made with the\n    body passed from our function, as well as the API key we stored earlier.\n 4. We'll receive a response of tags which we can do something with on the\n    application-side.\n\nWriting our Function\nWe'll start by writing a simple function as our go-between for our app and our\nservice:\n\nexports = function(img){\n   const http = context.services.get(\"GetClarifaiTags\");\n   var data = {\n        \"inputs\": [\n          {\n            \"data\": {\n              \"image\": {\n                \"url\": img\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      };\n      \n    var header_data = {\"Content-Type\": [ \"application/json\" ]};\n   \n    return http.post({\n        url: \"https://webhooks.mongodb-stitch.com/api/client/v2.0/app/hackers-uangn/service/GetClarifaiTags/incoming_webhook/GetTagsForNewImage\",\n        headers: header_data,\n        body: JSON.stringify(data)\n      })\n      .then(response => {\n      // The response body is encoded as raw BSON.Binary. Parse it to JSON.\n      const ejson_body = EJSON.parse(response.body.text());\n      return ejson_body;\n    });\n};\n\n\nThe first thing we do is reference our webhook (which we haven't created yet)\nwith this line:\n\nconst http = context.services.get(\"GetClarifaiTags\");\n\n\nIn the context of a function, context.services.get()  allows us to reference and\ninteract with other services we've created in Stitch. It's important to note\nthat we pass the user-created name of service we want to interact with. This is\none of the reasons why Stitch's documentation is so confusing - they\nconsistently use \"http\"  as an example service name. This seems to imply that\nwe'd want to import a type  of service as opposed to an instance  of a service,\nwhich is wrong.  \n\ndata  is the body of our request, which abides by Clarifai's documentation on\nhow to user their predict API. We need to pass this as a string to our webhook,\nthus we use JSON.stringify(data).\n\nIt's also important to note the structure of Mongo's headers when making\nrequests; notice that the value of each key pair is a list, as exemplified by \n\"Content-Type\": [ \"application/json\" ].\n\nAs you might imagine, these things in combination can cause a whole lot of\nconfusion. Hopefully you know a good blog to point these things out to you\nbeforehand.\n\nCreate a Webhook via 'HTTP Services'\nMove into the \"Services\" tab to create our webhook. Select HTTP  from the list\nof options:\n\nKind of a weird mix of services imho.Set your webhook to be a POST request.\nAuthentication shouldn't be a problem for us since we're only exposing this hook\nto our function, plus there are other ways to handle this.\n\nTIP: Don't post screenshots of sensitive endpoint URLs on the internet.The\nsyntax and methods available for writing a webhook are almost exactly the same\nas when writing regular functions. The one thing to note would be the presence\nof payload  being passed into the function; this object contains both the\nparameters and the body of requests being received by this endpoint. \npayload.body  gives us the body, whereas payload.query.arg  will give us the\nparameters.\n\nexports = function(payload){\n  const http = context.services.get(\"GetClarifaiTags\");\n  const token = context.values.get(\"clarifai_key\");\n  \n  var data = {};\n  if (payload.body) {\n    data = payload.body;\n  }\n  var header_data = {\n    \"Authorization\": [token], \n    \"Content-Type\": [\"application/json\"]\n  };\n\n    return http.post({\n        url: \"https://api.clarifai.com/v2/models/aaa03c23b3724a16a56b629203edc62c/versions/aa7f35c01e0642fda5cf400f543e7c40/outputs\",\n        body: data,\n        headers: header_data\n      })\n      .then(response => {\n      // The response body is encoded as raw BSON.Binary. Parse it to JSON.\n      const ejson_body = EJSON.parse(response.body.text());\n      return ejson_body;\n    });\n};\n\n\nJust as we can access services within functions, we can similarly access values\nvia context.values.get(\"myValue\").\n\nNow that we have both the body and our API key ready, we can actually go ahead\nand construct a valid request to Clarifai. The syntax should be\nself-explanatory, but here's the Stitch http service documentation\n[https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/services/http-actions/http.post/]  just in\ncase.\n\nWhy Did we Have to Make a Weird Webhook which is both Receiving and Posting\nInformation?\nThis is an excellent question and served to be a huge source of confusion for\nwhat must have been months. Go back to the \"Services\" tab, and pay close\nattention: for each service we create, a set of Rules  are automatically created\nand attached to our service. HTTP services have all functionality disabled room\ndefault, with little to no mention of the existence of rules in the first place. \n This is important for two reasons:\n\n 1. It's a silly UI hiccup that can waste the majority of your waking life.\n 2. This means that only  services can do things like post to external APIs.\n    This is why we didn't simply keep our logic in one function.\n\nOur Workflow in Practice\nAssuming you've added some logic to your app to pick out image URLs needing\ntags, our chain of events should be complete and return results to our\napplication. The POST request we make will return a response to the POST request\nof our function, and our function will return the results to our application.\nWe've successfully created a complex, albeit confusing, cloud architecture or\nexternal services.\n\nThis is where your imagination should hopefully kick in. You'll notice I have a\nfew services such as the endpoints which receive updates every time a JIRA issue\nis created or updated. This is what powers our public-facing kanban board.\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/projects/]","html":"<p>Friends, family, and most importantly, strangers: I approach you today with a tale of renewed inspiration.

Sometimes I'm struck by the allure of a cloud which\nfundamentally disregards schemas (wooo no schema party!). Other times, such as\nwhen Mongo decides to upgrade to a new version and you find all your production\ninstances broken, I like the ecosystem a bit less. \n\nMy biggest qualm with MongoDB is poor documentation. The \"tutorials\" and sample\ncode seems hacked-together, unmaintained, and worst of all, inconsistent with\nitself. Reading through the docs seems to always end up with Mongo forcing\nTwilio down my throat my for some miserable reason. \n\nJust to illustrate how bad things can get, below are two totally sets of\ndocumentation for what is supposed to be the same product. Mongo's main\ndocumentation on the left frequently references the bastardized documentation on\nthe right. What is the documentation on the right? It's a collection of\nnonsense\nliving on an S3 bucket\n[https://s3.amazonaws.com/stitch-sdks/js/docs/4.0.0/index.html]  which lists the\nmethods black-boxed into Stitch, often with zero explanation on how to actually\nutilize functionality.\n\nWhich one is real? And WHY?!How frustrating is this? I've had email user\nauthentication \"working\" for weeks as far as Stitch's logs say, although not a\nsingle user has actually been registered in that time. Anyways, I digress.\n\nMaking a Serverless Function\nStitch Serverless functions are of course strictly Javascript (MongoDB abides by\nECMA2015 features). In your Stitch console, check out the \"functions\" link in\nthe left hand nav:\n\nGo ahead and create a new function.There are just a few things we need to\nspecify when creating a new function:\n\n * The name of the function (duh).\n * Whether or not the function can be accessed \"publicly\". A \"Private\" function\n   is the equivalent of a function that only accessible to the VPC it belongs to\n   (although technically MongoDB Cloud doesn't use this terminology).\n * A condition which needs to be met in order for the function to execute.\n\nHere's a screenshot of everything we just went over. Because whatever.Switch\nover to the function editor to start really F*&king Sh!t up.\n\nMongo's Serverless Function Editor\nWe can call a Serverless function in a number of ways, with one of those ways\nbeing directly from our frontend code. In this case, we're basically just taking\na Javascript function which could  live in our frontend codebase and moving it\nto the cloud, thus functions can be passed any number of arguments (just like a\nnormal function).\n\nLuckily for us, Mongo provides some commented out boilerplate code when creating\na new function, which gives us an idea of what we might want to use these\nfunctions for:\n\nexports = function(arg){\n  /*\n    Accessing application's values:\n    var x = context.values.get(\"value_name\");\n\n    Accessing a mongodb service:\n    var collection = context.services.get(\"mongodb-atlas\").db(\"dbname\").collection(\"coll_name\");\n    var doc = collection.findOne({owner_id: context.user.id});\n\n    To call other named functions:\n    var result = context.functions.execute(\"function_name\", arg1, arg2);\n\n    Try running in the console below.\n  */\n  return {arg: arg};\n};\n\n\nPay special attention to context.services  here. When using a serverless\nfunction to access MongoDB services such as our database or endpoints, we can\naccess these via context.services  along with whichever service we're trying to\nmess with.\n\nQuerying our Database Within a Function\nLet's grab a single record from a collection in our Atlas collection:\n\nexports = function(arg){\n      const mongodb = context.services.get(\"mongodb-atlas\");\n      const collection = mongodb.db(\"blog\").collection(\"authors\");\n      var result = collection.findOne({\"author\": arg});\n      return result;\n};\n\n\nWe use findOne here to return an object, whereas we'd probably use toArray  if\nwe'd be expecting multiple results. The query we're running is contained within \nfindOne({\"author\": arg}). Our function takes an argument and returns a record\nwhere the value matches the argument: this makes our functions highly reusable,\nof course.\n\nCalling Our Function via Our App\nAs a recap, you have the option of including Stitch in your app either via a\nlink to a script or by installing the appropriate NPM modules. It's preferable\nto do the latter, but for the sake of this post, my patience with dealing with\nJavascript's babel browserify webpack gulp yarn npm requires package-lock .env\npipify facepunch  ecosystem has reached its limit. \n\nFeel free to follow in my footsteps of worst practices by embedding stitch\ndirectly:\n\n<script src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stitch-sdks/js/bundles/4.0.8/stitch.js\"></script>\n\n\nAuthenticating Before Calling Functions\nBefore making queries or interacting with any serverless functions of any kind,\nwe need to authenticate a 'user' with the server; even if that user is an\nanonymous one (it's in our own best benefit to know which user crashed the\nserver, even if that 'users' is a random string of numbers). Because we allowed\nanonymous users to peruse through our data, this is easy:\n\n// Authenticates anonymous user\nclient.auth.loginWithCredential(new stitch.AnonymousCredential()).then(user => {\n  console.log('logged in anonymously as user')\n});\n\n\nCalling our Function\nNow that that's done, we can call our function immediately after:\n\n// Authenticates anonymous user\nclient.auth.loginWithCredential(new stitch.AnonymousCredential()).then(user => {\n  console.log('logged in anonymously as user')\n});\n\n// Calls function\nclient.callFunction(\"getUsers\", [\"{{author}}\"]).then(result => {\n  console.log(result)\n});\n\n\nOur function is called get users  and we're passing a single parameter of \n{{author}}. Even though one parameter is being passed, we pass parameters as\nlists as Mongo Serverless functions, as these functions are agnostic to what\nmight be coming their way.\n\nUsing Functions to Grab Stored Values\nLet's look at one more use case where calling a Stitch Serverless function might\ncome in handy.\n\nBack in the Stitch UI, check out the \"values\" tab in the left-hand nav. This is\na place where we can store constant values which should accessible through our\napplication, or even a place to retrieve secrets:\n\n2secret4uValues can only be retrieved by functions, and this would be a good\ntime to ensure those particular functions are marked \"private\" For instance, if\nyou have an API call you need to make, It would be best to create a function\nthat handles the logic of that API call, and within that function, invoke\nanother private function whose job it is simply to retrieve the key in question.\nMake sense?  Ah well, you'll figure it out.\n\nMaking a Serverless Function that Does Something\nAnyway, let's apply our knowledge of functions to actually do something. On our\nsite we currently use a third party Medium widget which fetches stories from a\nuser's Medium account. Here's how that would look in its entirety:\n\n<script src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stitch-sdks/js/bundles/4.0.8/stitch.js\"></script>\n\n<script src=\"https://medium-widget.pixelpoint.io/widget.js\"></script>\n\n<script>\nfunction createMediumCard(medium){\n  console.log('medium= ' + medium);\n  MediumWidget.Init({\n    renderTo: '#medium-widget',\n    params: {\n      \"resource\": 'https://medium.com/' + medium,\n      \"postsPerLine\": 1,\n      \"limit\": 3,\n      \"picture\": \"small\",\n      \"fields\": [\"description\", \"publishAt\"],\n      \"ratio\": \"square\"\n    }\n  })\n  $('#medium').css('display', 'block');\n}\n    \nclient.auth.loginWithCredential(new stitch.AnonymousCredential()).then(user => {\n  console.log('logged in anonymously as user')\n});\n    \nclient.callFunction(\"getUsers\", [\"{{author}}\"]).then(result => {\n  console.log(result)\n});\n</script>\n\n\nNormally, \"resource\": medium,  would actually read the URL of the Medium profile\nwe're trying to embed. However, when you blog on a platform like Ghost which\nonly allows your authors to have either Facebook or Twitter profiles, we need to\nessentially go out of our way to build a second, nonintrusive database to pull\ndata from to add functionality like this. Yeah - I'll have to show you what MY\n\"stack\" looks like for a single blog theme some day. It's ridiculous.\n\nAnyway, that’s all I’ve got for now. I hope these ramblings help you assess\nMongoDB Cloud for yourself. No matter the provider, Enterprise Clouds target fat\nbudgets and are designed to rake in big money. It almost makes you wonder why\nsomebody would pay out of pocket for three of them just to write a stupid blog.","html":"<p>At times, I've found my opinion of <strong>MongoDB Atlas</strong> and <strong>MongoDB Stitch</strong> to waver between two extremes.

A lot of those cases cover the apps we\nbuild for ourselves: ones that let us do stupid things like spamming selfies or\nfilling the internet with vast mindless thoughts.\n\nMongoDB Atlas  is a hell of product in its own right, being a cloud NoSQL\ndatabase with the ability to execute queries similar to SQL JOINs, countless\naggregations, and more possibilities to work into a pipeline than I’ve even had\ntime to explore (we’ll get there). If you’ve ever been tasked to build endpoints\nfor yourself, chances are you already appreciate side-stepping the manual\none-to-one key association that comes with passing JSON to Lambda Functions or\nwhat-have-you.\n\nTake our situation at Hackers And Slackers, for instance. We’re running a Ghost\nblog, which is a young piece of software built by a non-profit organization:\nthis software is constantly being updated and improved, which means if we want\nto modify the logic of our Node app at all, our choices are:\n\n 1. Modify the Ghost source and refuse future updates\n 2. Merge our custom backend with Ghost changes in the event of an update\n 3. Build a third-party API using a platform such as AWS\n\nMongoDB Stitch  gives us a new fourth option: extend our app without all the\nrepetitive boilerplate.  I say extend  because it empowers us to build on top of\nthings which were previously black-boxed to us, such developing a theme atop a\nblogging system.\n\nCarrying on the Legacy\nMongoDB Stitch extends the philosophy of avoiding repetition. In a similar way\nto how NoSQL removed a pain point for many developers, Stitch wants you to keep\ndoing what you do best, which is probably writing NodeJS apps. Forever.\n\nIf I worked for Mongo, I’d sell the product like this:\n\nMongoDB Stitch empowers you to build powerful features without ever switching\ngears to the menial aspects of development.What I’m really saying is that MongoDB Stitch  is Google Firebase. Both products\ntarget the frontend  and mobile  developer markets, and both are very young and\nearly in fully achieving this goal. I’m watching the MongoDB product video for\nthe first time, and it feels like what I’ve assumed from using the product\naligns with their sell (good job on their part, I suppose):\n\nAs warm and uppity as that video is, Mongo has been rather bashful about their\nCloud. I'm guessing that has something to do with an IPO.\n\nOn the other hand, Google Firebase  has been tooting its own horn loudly for a\nyoung product, with a level of growth which feels almost reckless at times (I\nwon't get into it):\n\nAnyway, we're not here to compare. We're here to judge.\n\nGetting Started with a New Database\nFeel free to follow along by setting up a free tier cluster\n[https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/atlas-free-tier-setup/]. \n\nProper Mongo accounts are managed at https://cloud.mongodb.com  once created.\nThis landing dash has plenty of useful info and stats regarding the cluster\nitself. We'll also need to be sure that a database exists before we crate any\napps, otherwise we'll just be interacting with nothing.\n\nI highly  suggest using the MongoDB Compass  desktop app to connect to your your\ncluster. It's easy to download, and even saves you the time of entering\ncredentials by connecting with a copy+pasted URI:\n\nConnect with your database; emotionally.Within Compass, simply create a database\nand collection:\n\nIn MongoWorld, \"collections\" are the equivalent of \"tables\".Let's Get Stitched\nWith all that out of the way, head back to your account on the Mongo Cloud. Now\nour interest is entirely in the Stitch Apps  link on the left side nav:\n\nThere’s so much to explore!Create and name a new Stitch application, and we'll\nland on the \"getting started\" page. \n\nEnable anonymous auth & point to your collectionOnce we create our app, Stitch\nimmediately throws us in to a quick 101 of how to interact with our database.\nWe're going to use the exact example that Stitch gives us; it's important to\nhave the \"A-ha\" moment where everything comes together. \n\nBefore getting to any code, the only two things we need to do are:\n\n 1. Enable Anonymous Authentication: This is fancy language for creating a user\n    type where anybody who accesses our app can make queries\n 2. Pointing to our Mongo Collection: We need somewhere to store the data we'll\n    be messing with.\n\nConnecting Your App\nWe're going to copy and paste this code on to a page of our app. Once this is\nlive, visit the page and keep an eye on the console:\n\n<script src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stitch-sdks/js/bundles/4.0.8/stitch.js\"></script>\n\n<script>\n  const clientPromise = stitch.StitchClientFactory.create('hackerjira-bzmfe');\n  clientPromise.then(client => {\n    const db = client.service('mongodb', 'mongodb-atlas').db('HackersBlog');\n    client.login().then(() =>\n      db.collection('jira').updateOne({owner_id: client.authedId()}, {$set:{number:42}}, {upsert:true})\n    ).then(()=>\n      db.collection('jira').find({owner_id: client.authedId()}).limit(100).execute()\n    ).then(docs => {\n      console.log(\"Found docs\", docs)\n      console.log(\"[MongoDB Stitch] Connected to Stitch\")\n    }).catch(err => {\n      console.error(err)\n    });\n  });\n</script>\n\n\nChecking this on the live sites looks like this:\n\nNote the \"docs\" found in the console on the right.It worked, but what exactly?\nThe first thing the snippet tells the database to do is to upsert a row where\n\"number\" is equal to 42:\n\ndb.collection('jira').updateOne({owner_id: client.authedId()}, {$set:{number:42}}, {upsert:true})\n\n\nFor sanity, let's check the database to see what's up:\n\nIs that… a new record?!?!Sure enough, a new entry has been added to our database\nin the collection we specified. That's fun and all, but what about our actual\ndata? Isn't that what we came here for? Consider the next line:\n\ndb.collection('jira').find({owner_id: client.authedId()}).limit(100).execute()\n\n\nAhhh, we’re querying based on entries only  created from the current user!\nBecause the sample code we pasted creates a record, we can then query the\ndatabase for records created by that user. Let’s not ignore how cool that is\nhaving not actually done any work: we already have logic in place to allow\nanonymous users to create records and recognize them based on their session.\n\n.find()  is our bread and butter for retrieving records, much like SQL SELECT.\nSo in theory, to show all issues from this collection we'd just need to run the\nfollowing, right?\n\ndb.collection('jira').find({}).execute()\n\n\nSlow down there, buddy- but yes, pretty much. We just need to make read\npermissions public on the MongoDB Stitch side first. Back in the Stitch UI,\nselect \"Rules\" from the sidebar. Here, we can modify the rules for who can\nread/write which records from which DB:\n\nIt's less complicated than it looks.We can create rules as advanced as we'd\nlike, but the rules we need right now are simple enough to handle purely via the\nUI.\n\nGet All The Records\nGo ahead and add a bunch of records to your database collection. Experiment with\nimporting data via JSON or CSV, or just add some records one-by-one.\n\nWhen that's done, go back to your app and see what .find({})  comes back with:\n\nNow that's a collection.There they are: every record from a database collection,\ngrabbed with a single line of code on our frontend. Feel free to take a moment\nto reflect on this: we didn’t need to create an API, write logic, or log in to\nany shitty IAM policy management UIs. We didn’t even need to write a query; the\n‘query’ in this case is just a JSON object.\n\nStitching it All Together\nWhen I first reached this point, I experienced a rush of emotions: can creating\nnew features truly be this simple? If so, what have we been doing with our lives\nuntil this moment- repeating the same boilerplate and relearning the same\nconcepts as millions before us? Is this knowledge all worthless now? Does the\nexistence of Stitch reduce our lives’ greatest accomplishments to something that\ncan now be reproduced in minutes?\n\nWhile there are a great number of things that come easily with Stitch, there are\na fair share of headaches that come along with them. Many intricacies of complex\nflows and user management lack documentation or examples altogether. Creating a\ncloud based on ease-of-use even more frustrating: there’s not much that sucks\nmore than knowing something should be simple, but lacking the few lines of code\nto do it.\n\nThat’s where we’ll be filling in the blanks. Next time, we’ll take a look into\nStitch’s Serverless functions.","html":"<p>Some tools are simply the right tool for the job.

MongoDB the company is\nbold enough to place its bets on building a cloud far  simpler and restricted\nthan either AWS or GCloud. The core of that bet implies that most of us aren't\nexactly building unicorn products as much as we're reinventing the wheel: and\nthey're probably right.\n\nWelcome to our series on MongoDB cloud, where we break down every service\nMongoDB has to offer; one by one.\n\nWhat is MongoDB Cloud, and Does it Exist?\nWhat I refer to as \"MongoDB Cloud\" (which, for some reason, isn't the actual\nname of the suite MongoDB offers) is actually two products:\n\n * MongoDB Atlas: A cloud-hosted MongoDB cluster with a beefy set of features.\n   Real-time dashboards, high-availability, security features,  an awesome\n   desktop client, and a CLI to top it all off.\n * MongoDB Stitch: A group of services designed to interact with Atlas in every\n   conceivable way, including creating endpoints, triggers, user authentication\n   flows, serverless functions, and a UI to handle all of this.\n\nI'm spying on you and every query you make.Atlas as a Standalone Database\nThere are plenty of people who simply want an instance of MongoDB hosted in the\ncloud as-is: just ask the guys at mLab. This was in fact how I got pulled into\nMongo's cloud myself.\n\nMongoDB Atlas has plenty of advantages over a self-hosted instance of Mongo,\nwhich Mongo itself is confident in by offering a free tier\n[https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/atlas-free-tier-setup/]  of Atlas to\nprospective buyers. If you're a company or enterprise, the phrases High\nAvailability, Horizontal Scalability, relatively Higher Performance  will\nprobably be enough for you. But for us hobbyists, why pay for a Mongo cloud\ninstance?\n\nMongo themselves gives this comparison:\n\nOverview\n MongoDB Atlas\n Compose\n ObjectRocket\n Free Tier\n Yes\nStorage: 512 MB\nRAM: Variable\n No\n30-day free trial\n No\n30-day free trial\n Live migration\n Yes\nNo\nNo\nChoice of cloud providers\n AWS, Azure & GCP\n AWS, Softlayer & GCP\nAvailable in 2 regions for each provider\n Rackspace\n Choice of instance configuration\n Yes\n No\nConfiguration based on required storage capacity only.

Freedom over instance\nconfiguration sounds great, but in practice is more similar to putting a cap on\nhow much MongoDB decides to charge you that month (by the way, it's usually a\nlot; keep this mind). Having the Latest Version  seems great, but this can just\nas easily mean breaking production unannounced as much as it means new features.\n\nMongoDB clearly wins over the enterprise space with Continuous & queryable\nbackups, integration with LDAP, and automatic sharding support. Truthfully if\nthis were merely a database-level feature and cost comparison, the decision to\ngo with  MongoDB Atlas  would come down to how much you like their pretty\ndesktop interface:\n\nA perfectly legitimate reason to pay up, imho.So let's say MongoDB Atlas is\nmarginally better than a competitor in the confined realm of \"being a database.\"\nAre Stitch microservices enough to justify keeping your instance with the\nMongoDB team?\n\nService-by-Service Breakdown of Stitch\nStitch is kind of like if AWS exited in an alternative universe, where JSON and\nJavaScript were earth's only technologies. Thinking back to how we create APIs\nin AWS, the status quo almost always involves spinning up a Dynamo  (NoSQL)\ndatabase to put behind Lambda functions, accessible by API Gateway endpoints.\nStitch's core use case revolves around this use-case of end-user-accessing-data,\nwith a number of services dedicated specifically to supporting or improving this\nflow. The closest comparison to Stitch would be GCloud's Firebase. \n\nSo what makes Stitch so special?\n\nService 1: Querying Atlas Securely via Frontend Code\nSomething that cannot be understated is the ability to query Atlas via frontend\nJavascript. We're not passing API keys, Secrets, or any sort of nonsense;\nbecause you're configured things correctly, whitelisted domains can run queries\nof any complexity without ever interacting with an app's backend.  This is not a\ncrazy use case: consider this blog for example, or more so lately, mobile\napplications:\n\n<script src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stitch-sdks/js/bundles/4.0.8/stitch.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  const client = stitch.Stitch.initializeDefaultAppClient('myapp');\n\n  const db = client.getServiceClient(stitch.RemoteMongoClient.factory, 'mongodb-atlas').db('<DATABASE>');\n\n  client.auth.loginWithCredential(new stitch.AnonymousCredential()).then(user => \n    db.collection('<COLLECTION>').updateOne({owner_id: client.auth.user.id}, {$set:{number:42}}, {upsert:true})\n  ).then(() => \n    db.collection('<COLLECTION>').find({owner_id: client.auth.user.id}, { limit: 100}).asArray()\n  ).then(docs => {\n      console.log(\"Found docs\", docs)\n      console.log(\"[MongoDB Stitch] Connected to Stitch\")\n  }).catch(err => {\n    console.error(err)\n  });\n</script>\n\n\nThis isn't to say we're allowing any user to query any data all willy-nilly just\nbecause they're on our whitelisted IP: all data stored in Atlas is restricted to\nspecified Users  by defining User Roles. Joe Schmoe can't just inject a query\ninto any presumed database and wreak havoc, because Joe Schmoe can only access\ndata we've permitted his user account to view or write to. What is this \"user\naccount\" you ask? This brings us to the next big feature...\n\nService 2: End-User Account Creation & Management\nStitch will handle user account creation for you without the boilerplate.\nCreating an app with user accounts is a huge pain in the ass. Cheeky phrases\nlike 'Do the OAuth Dance'  can't ever hope to minimize the agonizing repetitive\npain of creating user accounts or managing relationships between users and data\n(can user X  see a comment from user Y?). Stitch allows most of the intolerably\nbenign logic behind these features to be handled via a UI.\n\nIt would be a far cry to say these processes have been \"trivialized\", but the\ntime saved is perhaps just enough to keep a coding hobbyist interested in their\nside projects as opposed to giving up and playing Rocket League.\n\nAs far as the permissions to read comments go... well, here's a self-explanatory\nscreenshot of how Stitch handles read/write document permission in its simplest\nform:\n\nOwners of comments can write their comments. Everybody else reads. Seems simple.\nService 3: Serverless Functions\nStitch functions are akin to AWS Lambda functions, but much easier to configure\nfor cross-service integration (and also limited to JavaScript ECMA 2015 or\nsomething). Functions benefit from the previous two features, in that they too\ncan be triggered from a whitelisted app's frontend, and are governed by a simple\n\"rules\" system, eliminating the need for security group configurations etc.\n\nThis is what calling a function from an app's frontend looks like:\n\n<script>\n    client.auth.loginWithCredential(new stitch.AnonymousCredential()).then(user => {\n     client.callFunction(\"numCards\", [\"In Progress\"]).then(results => {\n       $('#progress .count').text(results + ' issues');\n     })\n    });\n</script>\n\n\nFunctions can run any query against Atlas, retrieve values  (such as environment\nvariables), and even call other functions. Functions can also be fired by\ndatabase triggers,  where a change to a collection will prompt an action such as\nan alert.\n\nService 4: HTTP Webhooks\nWebhooks are a fast way to toss up endpoints. Stitch endpoints are agnostic to\none another in that they are one-off URLs to perform single tasks. We could\nnever build a well-designed API using Stitch Webhooks, as we could with API\nGateway; this simply isn't the niche MongoDB is trying to hit (the opposite, in\nfact). \n\nConfiguration for a single Webhook.This form with a mere 6 fields clearly\nillustrates what Stitch intends to do: trivializing the creation of\ntraditionally non-trivial features.\n\nService 5: Storing 'Values' in Stitch\nA \"value\" is equivalent to an environment variable. These can be used to store\nAPI keys, secrets, or whatever. Of course, values are retrieved via functions.\n\nShhh, it's a secret ;)Service 6+: A Bunch of Mostly Bloated Extras\nFinally, Stitch has thrown in a few third-party integrations for good measure.\nSome integrations like S3 Integration could definitely come in handy, but it's\nworth asking why Mongo constantly over advertises their integrations with Github \n and Twilio. We've already established that we can create endpoints which accept\ninformation, and we can make functions which GET  information... so isn't\nanything with an API pretty easy to 'integrate' with?\n\nThis isn't to say the extra services aren't useful, they just seem a bit... odd.\nIt feels a lot like bloating the catalog, but the catalog isn't nearly bloated\nenough where it feels normal (like Heroku add-ons, for example). The choice to\nlaunch Stitch with a handful of barely-useful integrations only comes off as\nmore and more aimless as time passes; as months turn to years and no additions\nor updates are made to service offerings, it's worth questioning what the vision\nhad been for the product in the first place. In my experience, feature sets like\nthese happen when Product Managers are more powerful than they are useful.\n\nThe Breathtaking Climax: Is Stitch Worth It?\nI've been utilizing Stitch to fill in the blanks in development for months now,\nperhaps nearly a year. Each time I find myself working with Stitch or looking at\nthe bill, I can't decide if it's been a Godsend for its nich\u001dé, or an expensive\ntoy with an infuriating lack of accurate documentation.\n\n  Stitch is very much a copy-and-paste-cookie-cutter-code  type of product,\nwhich begs the question of why their tutorials are recklessly outdated;\nsometimes to the point where MongoDB's own tutorial source code doesn't work. \nThere are so many use cases and potential benefits to Stitch, so why is the \nGithub repo [https://github.com/mongodb/stitch-examples]  containing example\ncode snippets so unmaintained, and painfully irrelevant? Lastly, why am I\nselling this product harder than their own internal team?\n\nStitch is a good product with a lot of unfortunate oversight. That said, Google\nFirebase still doesn't even have an \"import data\" feature, so I suppose it's\ntime to dig deep into this vendor lock and write a 5-post series about it before\nSilicon Valley's best and brightest get their shit together enough to actually\ncreate something useful and intuitive for other human beings to use. In the\nmeantime, feel free to steal source from tutorials I'll be posting, because\nthey'll be sure to, you know, actually work.","html":"<p>Unless you've been living under a rock (or only visit this site via work-related Google Searches, like most people) you've probably heard me drone on here and there about <strong>MongoDB Atlas</strong> and <strong>MongoDB Stitch</strong>.

Freedom over <strong>instance configuration </strong>sounds great, but in practice is more similar to putting a cap on how much MongoDB decides to charge you that month (by the way, it's usually a lot; keep this mind). Having the <strong>Latest Version</strong> seems great, but this can just as easily mean breaking production unannounced as much as it means new features.</p><p>MongoDB clearly wins over the enterprise space with <strong>Continuous &amp; queryable backups</strong>, integration with <strong>LDAP, </strong>and <strong>automatic sharding support. </strong>Truthfully if this were merely a database-level feature and cost comparison, the decision to go with<strong> MongoDB Atlas</strong> would come down to how much you like their pretty desktop interface:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/compass.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>A perfectly legitimate reason to pay up, imho.</figcaption></figure><p>So let's say MongoDB Atlas is marginally better than a competitor in the confined realm of \"being a database.\" Are Stitch microservices enough to justify keeping your instance with the MongoDB team?</p><h2 id=\"service-by-service-breakdown-of-stitch\">Service-by-Service Breakdown of Stitch</h2><p>Stitch is kind of like if AWS exited in an alternative universe, where JSON and JavaScript were earth's only technologies. Thinking back to how we create APIs in AWS, the status quo almost always involves spinning up a <strong>Dynamo</strong> (NoSQL) database to put behind <strong>Lambda </strong>functions, accessible by <strong>API Gateway </strong>endpoints. Stitch's core use case revolves around this use-case of <em>end-user-accessing-data</em>, with a number of services dedicated specifically to supporting or improving this flow. The closest comparison to Stitch would be GCloud's <strong>Firebase</strong>. </p><p>So what makes Stitch so special?</p><h3 id=\"service-1-querying-atlas-securely-via-frontend-code\">Service 1: Querying Atlas Securely via Frontend Code</h3><p>Something that cannot be understated is the ability to query Atlas via frontend Javascript. We're not passing API keys, Secrets, or any sort of nonsense; because you're configured things correctly, whitelisted domains can run queries of any complexity <em>without ever interacting with an app's backend.</em> This is not a crazy use case: consider this blog for example, or more so lately, mobile applications:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&lt;script src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/stitch-sdks/js/bundles/4.0.8/stitch.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n  const client = stitch.Stitch.initializeDefaultAppClient('myapp');\n\n  const db = client.getServiceClient(stitch.RemoteMongoClient.factory, 'mongodb-atlas').db('&lt;DATABASE&gt;');\n\n  client.auth.loginWithCredential(new stitch.AnonymousCredential()).then(user =&gt; \n    db.collection('&lt;COLLECTION&gt;').updateOne({owner_id: client.auth.user.id}, {$set:{number:42}}, {upsert:true})\n  ).then(() =&gt; \n    db.collection('&lt;COLLECTION&gt;').find({owner_id: client.auth.user.id}, { limit: 100}).asArray()\n  ).then(docs =&gt; {\n      console.log(&quot;Found docs&quot;, docs)\n      console.log(&quot;[MongoDB Stitch] Connected to Stitch&quot;)\n  }).catch(err =&gt; {\n    console.error(err)\n  });\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This isn't to say we're allowing any user to query any data all willy-nilly just because they're on our whitelisted IP: all data stored in Atlas is restricted to specified <strong>Users</strong> by defining <strong>User Roles. </strong>Joe Schmoe can't just inject a query into any presumed database and wreak havoc, because Joe Schmoe can only access data we've permitted his user account to view or write to. What is this \"user account\" you ask? This brings us to the next big feature...</p><h3 id=\"service-2-end-user-account-creation-management\">Service 2: End-User Account Creation &amp; Management</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/Screen-Shot-2018-11-13-at-5.59.03-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Stitch will handle user account creation for you without the boilerplate.</figcaption></figure><p>Creating an app with user accounts is a huge pain in the ass. Cheeky phrases like '<strong>Do the OAuth Dance'</strong> can't ever hope to minimize the agonizing repetitive pain of creating user accounts or managing relationships between users and data (can <em>user X</em> see a comment from <em>user Y</em>?). Stitch allows most of the intolerably benign logic behind these features to be handled via a UI.</p><p>It would be a far cry to say these processes have been \"trivialized\", but the time saved is perhaps just enough to keep a coding hobbyist interested in their side projects as opposed to giving up and playing Rocket League.</p><p>As far as the permissions to read comments go... well, here's a self-explanatory screenshot of how Stitch handles read/write document permission in its simplest form:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-5.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/Screen-Shot-2018-11-13-at-6.09.25-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Owners of comments can write their comments. Everybody else reads. Seems simple.</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"service-3-serverless-functions\">Service 3: Serverless Functions</h3><p>Stitch functions are akin to AWS Lambda functions, but much easier to configure for cross-service integration (and also limited to JavaScript ECMA 2015 or something). Functions benefit from the previous two features, in that they too can be triggered from a whitelisted app's frontend, and are governed by a simple \"rules\" system, eliminating the need for security group configurations etc.</p><p>This is what calling a function from an app's frontend looks like:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&lt;script&gt;\n    client.auth.loginWithCredential(new stitch.AnonymousCredential()).then(user =&gt; {\n     client.callFunction(&quot;numCards&quot;, [&quot;In Progress&quot;]).then(results =&gt; {\n       $('#progress .count').text(results + ' issues');\n     })\n    });\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Functions can run any query against Atlas, retrieve <em>values</em> (such as environment variables), and even call other functions. Functions can also be fired by database <strong>triggers,</strong> where a change to a collection will prompt an action such as an alert.</p><h3 id=\"service-4-http-webhooks\">Service 4: HTTP Webhooks</h3><p>Webhooks are a fast way to toss up endpoints. Stitch endpoints are agnostic to one another in that they are one-off URLs to perform single tasks. We could never build a well-designed API using Stitch Webhooks, as we could with <strong>API Gateway</strong>; this simply isn't the niche MongoDB is trying to hit (the opposite, in fact). </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/Screen-Shot-2018-11-14-at-4.33.27-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Configuration for a single Webhook.</figcaption></figure><p>This form with a mere 6 fields clearly illustrates what Stitch intends to do: trivializing the creation of traditionally non-trivial features.</p><h3 id=\"service-5-storing-values-in-stitch\">Service 5: Storing 'Values' in Stitch</h3><p>A \"value\" is equivalent to an environment variable. These can be used to store API keys, secrets, or whatever. Of course, values are retrieved via functions.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/Screen-Shot-2018-11-14-at-7.45.28-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Shhh, it's a secret ;)</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"service-6-a-bunch-of-mostly-bloated-extras\">Service 6+: A Bunch of Mostly Bloated Extras</h3><p>Finally, Stitch has thrown in a few third-party integrations for good measure. Some integrations like <strong>S3 Integration </strong>could definitely come in handy, but it's worth asking why Mongo constantly over advertises their integrations with <strong>Github</strong> and <strong>Twilio</strong>. We've already established that we can create endpoints which accept information, and we can make functions which <em>GET</em> information... so isn't anything with an API pretty easy to 'integrate' with?</p><p>This isn't to say the extra services aren't useful, they just seem a bit... odd. It feels a lot like bloating the catalog, but the catalog isn't nearly bloated enough where it feels normal (like Heroku add-ons, for example). The choice to launch Stitch with a handful of barely-useful integrations only comes off as more and more aimless as time passes; as months turn to years and no additions or updates are made to service offerings, it's worth questioning what the vision had been for the product in the first place. In my experience, feature sets like these happen when Product Managers are more powerful than they are useful.</p><h2 id=\"the-breathtaking-climax-is-stitch-worth-it\">The Breathtaking Climax: Is Stitch Worth It?</h2><p>I've been utilizing Stitch to fill in the blanks in development for months now, perhaps nearly a year. Each time I find myself working with Stitch or looking at the bill, I can't decide if it's been a Godsend for its nich\u001dé, or an expensive toy with an infuriating lack of accurate documentation.</p><p> Stitch is very much a <em>copy-and-paste-cookie-cutter-code</em> type of product, which begs the question of why their tutorials are recklessly outdated; sometimes to the point where MongoDB's own tutorial source code <em>doesn't work. </em>There are so many use cases and potential benefits to Stitch, so why is the <a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/stitch-examples\">Github repo</a> containing example code snippets so unmaintained, and painfully irrelevant? Lastly, why am I selling this product harder than their own internal team?</p><p>Stitch is a good product with a lot of unfortunate oversight. That said, Google Firebase still doesn't even have an \"import data\" feature, so I suppose it's time to dig deep into this vendor lock and write a 5-post series about it before Silicon Valley's best and brightest get their shit together enough to actually create something useful and intuitive for other human beings to use. In the meantime, feel free to steal source from tutorials I'll be posting, because they'll be sure to, you know, actually work.</p>","url":"https://hackersandslackers.com/mongodb-cloud-backend-as-a-service-with-atlas-and-stitch/","uuid":"5555fa6e-07f0-4f9a-8069-e1e68868e608","page":false,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"comment_id":"5beb3c900dbec217f3ce801b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"mongodb-cloud","limit":12,"skip":0,"numberOfPages":1,"humanPageNumber":1,"prevPageNumber":null,"nextPageNumber":null,"previousPagePath":null,"nextPagePath":null}}
