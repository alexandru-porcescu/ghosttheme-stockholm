Now that we're all feeling a bit more\ncomfortable, it may be time to let everybody in on the world's worst-kept\nsecret: Almost nobody builds architecture by interacting with the AWS UI\ndirectly. There are plenty examples of how this is done, with the main example\nbeing HashiCorp:  an entire business model based around the premise that AWS has\na shitty UI, to the point where it's easier to write code to make things which\nwill host your code. What a world.\n\nIn the case of creating Python Lambda functions, the \"official\" (aka: manual)\nworkflow of deploying your code to AWS is something horrible like this:\n\n * You start a project locally and begin development.\n * You opt to use virtualenv, because you're well aware that you're going to\n   need the source for any packages you use available.\n * When you're ready to 'deploy' to AWS, you copy all your dependencies from \n   /site-packages  and move them into your root directory, temporarily creating\n   an abomination of a project structure.\n * With your project fully bloated and confused, you cherry pick the files\n   needed to zip into an archive.\n * Finally, you upload your code via zip either to Lambda directory or to S3,\n   only to run your code, realize its broken, and need to start all over.\n\nThere Must be a Better Way\nIndeed there is, and surprisingly enough the solution is 100% Python (sorry\nHashiCorp, we'll talk another time). This \"better way\" is my personal method of\nleveraging the following:\n\n * The official AWS CLI\n   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html].\n * Pipenv [https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/]  as an environment manager.\n * Python's python-lambda [https://github.com/nficano/python-lambda]  package:\n   the magic behind it all.\n\nObligatory \"Installing the CLI\" Recap\nFirst off, make sure you're using a compatible version of Python on your system,\nas AWS is still stuck on version 3.6. Look, we can't all be Google Cloud (and by\nthe way, Python 2.7 doesn't count as compatible - let it die before your career\ndoes).\n\n$ pip3 install awscli --upgrade --user\n\n\nIf you're working off an EC2 instance, it has come to my attention pip3 does not\ncome preinstalled. Remember to run: * $ apt update\n * $ apt upgrade\n * $ apt install python3-pip\n\nYou may be prompted to run apt install awscli  as well.Awesome, now that we have\nthe CLI installed on the real  version of Python, we need to store your\ncredentials. Your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key can be found in your IAM\npolicy manager.\n\n$ aws configure\nAWS Access Key ID [None]: YOURKEY76458454535\nAWS Secret Access Key [None]: SECRETKEY*^R(*$76458397045609365493\nDefault region name [None]:\nDefault output format [None]:\n\nOn both Linux and OSX, this should generate files found under cd ~/.aws  which\nwill be referenced by default whenever you use an AWS service moving forward.\n\nSet Up Your Environment\nAs mentioned, we'll use pipenv  for easy environment management. We'll create an\nenvironment using Lambda's preferred Python version:\n\n$ pip3 install pipenv\n$ pipenv shell --python 3.6\n\nCreating a virtualenv for this project…\nPipfile: /home/example/Pipfile\nUsing /usr/bin/python3 (3.6.6) to create virtualenv…\n⠇Already using interpreter /usr/bin/python3\nUsing base prefix '/usr'\nNew python executable in /root/.local/share/virtualenvs/example-RnlD17kd/bin/python3\nAlso creating executable in /root/.local/share/virtualenvs/example-RnlD17kd/bin/python\nInstalling setuptools, pip, wheel...done.\n\n\nSomething you should be aware of at the time of writing: Pip's latest version,\n18.1, is actually a breaking change  for Pipenv. Thus, the first thing we should\ndo is force usage of pip 18.0 (is there even a fix for this yet?). This is\nsolved by typing pip3 install pip==18.0  with the Pipenv shell activated. Now\nlet's get to the easy part.\n\npython-lambda: The Savior of AWS\nSo far we've made our lives easier in two ways: we're keeping our AWS\ncredentials safe and far away from ourselves, and we have what is by far the\nsuperior Python package management solution. But this is all foreplay leading up\nto python-lambda:\n\n$ pip3 install python-lambda\n\n\nThis library alone is about to do you the following favors:\n\n * Initiate your Lambda project structure for you.\n * Isolate Lambda configuration to a  config.yaml  file, covering everything\n   from the name of your entry point, handler function, and even\n   program-specific variables.\n * Allow you to run tests locally, where a test.json  file simulates a request\n   being made to your function locally.\n * Build a production-ready zip file with all dependencies completely separated \n   from your beautiful file structure.\n * The ability to deploy directly  to S3 or Lambda with said zip file from\n   command-line.\n\nCheck out the commands for yourself:\n\nCommands:\n  build      Bundles package for deployment.\n  cleanup    Delete old versions of your functions\n  deploy     Register and deploy your code to lambda.\n  deploy-s3  Deploy your lambda via S3.\n  init       Create a new function for Lambda.\n  invoke     Run a local test of your function.\n  upload     Upload your lambda to S3.\n\n\nInitiate your project\nRunning lambda init  will generate the following file structure:\n\n.\n├── Pipfile\n├── config.yaml\n├── event.json\n└── service.py\n\n\nChecking out the entry point: service.py\npython-lambda starts you off with a basic handler as an example of a working\nproject. Feel free to rename service.py  and its handler function to whatever\nyou please, as we can configure that in a bit.\n\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\ndef handler(event, context):\n    # Your code goes here!\n    e = event.get('e')\n    pi = event.get('pi')\n    return e + pi\n\n\nEasy configuration via configure.yaml\nThe base config generated by lambda init  looks like this:\n\nregion: us-east-1\n\nfunction_name: my_lambda_function\nhandler: service.handler\ndescription: My first lambda function\nruntime: python3.6\n# role: lambda_basic_execution\n\n# S3 upload requires appropriate role with s3:PutObject permission\n# (ex. basic_s3_upload), a destination bucket, and the key prefix\n# bucket_name: 'example-bucket'\n# s3_key_prefix: 'path/to/file/'\n\n# if access key and secret are left blank, boto will use the credentials\n# defined in the [default] section of ~/.aws/credentials.\naws_access_key_id:\naws_secret_access_key:\n\n# dist_directory: dist\n# timeout: 15\n# memory_size: 512\n# concurrency: 500\n#\n\n# Experimental Environment variables\nenvironment_variables:\n    env_1: foo\n    env_2: baz\n\n# If `tags` is uncommented then tags will be set at creation or update\n# time.  During an update all other tags will be removed except the tags\n# listed here.\n#tags:\n#    tag_1: foo\n#    tag_2: bar\n\n\nLook familiar? These are all the properties you would normally have to set up\nvia the UI. As an added bonus, you can store values (such as S3 bucket names for\nboto3) in this file as well. That's dope.\n\nSetting up event.json\nThe default event.json  is about as simplistic as you can get, and naturally not\nvery helpful at first (it isn't meant to be). These are the contents:\n\n{\n  \"pi\": 3.14,\n  \"e\": 2.718\n}\n\n\nWe can replace this a real test JSON which we can grab from Lambda itself.\nHere's an example of a Cloudwatch event we can use instead:\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"cdc73f9d-aea9-11e3-9d5a-835b769c0d9c\",\n  \"detail-type\": \"Scheduled Event\",\n  \"source\": \"aws.events\",\n  \"account\": \"{{account-id}}\",\n  \"time\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"region\": \"us-east-1\",\n  \"resources\": [\n    \"arn:aws:events:us-east-1:123456789012:rule/ExampleRule\"\n  ],\n  \"pi\": 3.14,\n  \"e\": 2.718\n  \"detail\": {}\n}\n\n\nRemember that event.json  is what is being passed to our handler as the event \nparameter. Thus, now we can run our Lambda function locally  to see if it works:\n\n$ lambda invoke\n5.8580000000000005\n\n\nPretty cool if you ask me.\n\nDeploy it, Ship it, Roll Credits\nAfter you express your coding genius, remember to output pip freeze >\nrequirements.txt. python-lambda  will use this as a reference for which packages\nneed to be included. This is neat because we can use Pipenv and the benefits of\nthe workflow it provides while still easily outputting what we need to deploy. \n\nBecause we already specified which Lambda we're going to deploy to in \nconfig.yaml, we can deploy to that Lambda immediately. lambda deploy  will use\nthe zip upload method, whereas lambda deploy-s3  will store your source on S3.\n\nIf you'd like to deploy the function yourself, run with lambda build  which will\nzip your source code plus dependencies  neatly into a /dist  directory. Suddenly\nwe never have to compromise our project structure, and now we can easily source\ncontrol our Lambdas by .gitignoring our build folders while hanging on to our\nPipfiles.\n\nHere's to hoping you never need to deploy Lambdas using any other method ever\nagain.

We've also briefly covered\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/building-an-api-using-aws/]  the general concept\nbehind what Lambda functions. In case you've already forgotten, Lambdas are\nbasically just chunks of code in the cloud; think of them as tiny virtual\nservers, which have already been configured (and locked down) to serve one\nspecific purpose. Because that's literally what it is.\n\nThe data being stored in RDS is ultimately what we're targeting, and Lambdas \nserve as the in-between logic to serve up, modify, or add to the proper data.\nThe only piece missing from the picture is API Gateway. \n\nAs the name suggests, API Gateway  is the, uh, gateway  that users or systems\ninteract with to obtain what they're seeking. It is (hopefully) the only part of\nthis VPC structure an external user can interact with:\n\nSimple API to interact with RDS.Serving as a \"gateway\" is obviously what all\nAPIs so, but the term is also true in the sense that API Gateway  is completely\nconfigured via UI, thus engineers of any programming background can safely\nmodify endpoints, methods,  CORs  configurations, or any of the high-level API\nstructure without being locked into a programming language. API Gateway  is\ntherefore very much an enterprise-geared product: it lends itself to large teams\nand scaling. That said, if it were to be compared to building an API via a\nframework designed to do such things (such as Express or Flask) the experience\nis undoubtedly more clunky. The trade-off being made for speed is immediate\nvisibility, assurance, and a higher chance for collaboration.\n\nThe Challenge of Building a \"Well-Designed\" API\nGood APIs are premeditated. A complex API might accept multiple methods per\nendpoint, allow advanced filtering of results, or handle advanced\nAuthentication. Neither of us have the time to attempt covering all of those\nthings in detail, but I will  leave you with the knowledge that all these\nfeatures are very much possible.\n\nThe API Gateway  interface is where you'd get started. Let's blow through the\nworld's most inappropriately fast explanation of building APIs ever ,and check\nout the UI:\n\nIt ain't pretty, but it works. * Your APIs are listed on the left. You can create more than one, if you're\n   some sort of sadist.\n * The Resources pane is the full structure of your API. At the highest level,\n   'resources' refers to Endpoints,  which are the URLs your API will ultimately\n   expose.\n * Every Endpoint  can contain whichever Methods  you choose to associate with\n   them (GET, POST, PUT, etc). Even if they belong to the same endpoint, a POST\n   method could contain entirely unrelated logic from a PUT method: its your\n   responsibility to make sure your API design makes sense.\n * Finally, each Method has their expected Request and Response  structures\n   defined individually, which what the horribly designed box diagram is\n   attempting to explain on the right. The box on the left labeled CLIENT refers\n   to the requester, where the box on the right represents the triggered action.\n\nThis UI is your bread and butter. I hope you're strapped in, because walking\nthrough this interface is going to be hella boring for all of us.\n\nCreating a Method Request\nThe first step to creating an endpoint (let's say a GET endpoint) is to set the\nexpectation for what the user will send to us:\n\nAwe yea, authorization. 1. Authorization  allows you to restrict users from using your API unless they\n    follow your IAM policy.\n 2. Request Validator  lets you chose if you'd like this validation to happen\n    via the body, query string parameters, headers, or all of the above.\n 3. API Keys  are useful if you're creating an API to sell commercially or\n    enforce limited access. If your business model revolves around selling an\n    API, you can realistically do this.\n 4. Query String Parameters  are... actually forget it, you know this by now.\n 5. See above.\n 6. If preferred, the Request Body can be assigned a model,  which is\n    essentially a JSON schema. If a request is made to your endpoint which does\n    not match the request body model, it is a malformed request. We'll cover \n    models  in the advanced course, once somebody actually starts paying me to\n    write this stuff.\n\nMethod Execution: AKA \"What do we do with this?\"\nSet the game plan. 1. Integration Type  specifies which AWS service will be accepting or affected\n    by this request. The vast majority of the time, this will be Lambda. If\n    you're wondering why other AWS Services aren't present, this has been made\n    intentional over time as just about any AWS service you can interact with\n    will still need logic to do anything useful: you can't just shove a JSON\n    object in a database's face and expect to get results. Unless you're using\n    MongoDB or something.\n 2. Lambda Proxies  are generally a bad idea. They auto-format your Lambda's \n    request  and response  body to follow a very  specific structure, which is\n    presumably intended to help speed up or standardize development.

We've also <a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/building-an-api-using-aws/\">briefly covered</a> the general concept behind what <strong>Lambda functions</strong>. In case you've already forgotten, Lambdas are basically just chunks of code in the cloud; think of them as tiny virtual servers, which have already been configured (and locked down) to serve one specific purpose. Because that's literally what it is.</p><p>The data being stored in <strong>RDS </strong>is ultimately what we're targeting, and <strong>Lambdas</strong> serve as the in-between logic to serve up, modify, or add to the proper data. The only piece missing from the picture is <strong>API Gateway</strong>. </p><p>As the name suggests, <strong>API Gateway</strong> is the, uh, <em>gateway</em> that users or systems interact with to obtain what they're seeking. It is (hopefully) the only part of this VPC structure an external user can interact with:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-2.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/apigateway_o-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Simple API to interact with RDS.</figcaption></figure><p>Serving as a \"gateway\" is obviously what all APIs so, but the term is also true in the sense that <strong>API Gateway</strong> is completely configured via UI, thus engineers of any programming background can safely modify <em>endpoints</em>, <em>methods,</em> <em>CORs</em> configurations, or any of the high-level API structure without being locked into a programming language. <strong>API Gateway</strong> is therefore very much an enterprise-geared product: it lends itself to large teams and scaling. That said, if it were to be compared to building an API via a framework designed to do such things (such as Express or Flask) the experience is undoubtedly more clunky. The trade-off being made for speed is immediate visibility, assurance, and a higher chance for collaboration.</p><h2 id=\"the-challenge-of-building-a-well-designed-api\">The Challenge of Building a \"Well-Designed\" API</h2><p>Good APIs are premeditated. A complex API might accept multiple methods per endpoint, allow advanced filtering of results, or handle advanced Authentication. Neither of us have the time to attempt covering all of those things in detail, but I <em>will</em> leave you with the knowledge that all these features are very much possible.  </p><p>The <strong>API Gateway</strong> interface is where you'd get started. Let's blow through the world's most inappropriately fast explanation of building APIs ever ,and check out the UI:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-5.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/apigateway_overview3.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>It ain't pretty, but it works.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Your <strong>APIs </strong>are listed on the left. You can create more than one, if you're some sort of sadist.</li><li>The <strong>Resources </strong>pane is the full structure of your API. At the highest level, 'resources' refers to <strong>Endpoints,</strong> which are the URLs your API will ultimately expose.</li><li>Every <strong>Endpoint</strong> can contain whichever <strong>Methods</strong> you choose to associate with them (GET, POST, PUT, etc). Even if they belong to the same endpoint, a POST method could contain entirely unrelated logic from a PUT method: its your responsibility to make sure your API design makes sense.</li><li>Finally, each <strong>Method </strong>has their expected <strong>Request </strong>and <strong>Response</strong> structures defined individually, which what the horribly designed box diagram is attempting to explain on the right. The box on the left labeled CLIENT refers to the requester, where the box on the right represents the triggered action.</li></ul><p>This UI is your bread and butter. I hope you're strapped in, because walking through this interface is going to be hella boring for all of us.</p><h3 id=\"creating-a-method-request\">Creating a Method Request</h3><p>The first step to creating an endpoint (let's say a GET endpoint) is to set the expectation for what the user will send to us:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/methodrequest_o.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Awe yea, authorization.</figcaption></figure><ol><li><strong>Authorization</strong> allows you to restrict users from using your API unless they follow your IAM policy.</li><li><strong>Request Validator</strong> lets you chose if you'd like this validation to happen via the body, query string parameters, headers, or all of the above.</li><li><strong>API Keys</strong> are useful if you're creating an API to sell commercially or enforce limited access. If your business model revolves around selling an API, you can realistically do this.</li><li><strong>Query String Parameters</strong> are... actually forget it, you know this by now.</li><li>See above.</li><li>If preferred, the <strong>Request Body </strong>can be assigned a <strong>model,</strong> which is essentially a JSON schema. If a request is made to your endpoint which does not match the request body model, it is a malformed request. We'll cover <strong>models</strong> in the advanced course, once somebody actually starts paying me to write this stuff.</li></ol><h3 id=\"method-execution-aka-what-do-we-do-with-this\">Method Execution: AKA \"What do we do with this?\"</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/methodexecution_o.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Set the game plan.</figcaption></figure><ol><li><strong>Integration Type</strong> specifies which AWS service will be accepting or affected by this request. The vast majority of the time, this will be Lambda. If you're wondering why other AWS Services aren't present, this has been made intentional over time as just about any AWS service you can interact with will still need logic to do anything useful: you can't just shove a JSON object in a database's face and expect to get results. Unless you're using MongoDB or something.</li><li><strong>Lambda Proxies</strong> are generally a bad idea. They auto-format your Lambda's <em>request</em> and <em>response</em> body to follow a very  specific structure, which is presumably intended to help speed up or standardize development.

Fuck,\nlet's just move on.\n\nSimple Project Configuration\nPerhaps majority of what one needs to learn to deploy apps is contained within a\nsingle YAML file. Add a YAML file in your directory:\n\nruntime: python37\napi_version: 1\n\nhandlers:\n  # This configures Google App Engine to serve the files in the app's static\n  # directory.\n- url: static\n  static_dir: static\n\n  # This handler routes all requests not caught above to your main app.\n  # Required when static routes are defined. \n  # Can be omitted when there are no static files defined.\n- url: /.*\n  script: auto\n\n\nSet your Static directory if you're working in Python.

Just remember that Google prefers <strong>requirements.txt </strong>over other forms of package management (Google will actually bar Pipfile from being committed, interestingly enough). </p><p>If you're working locally, <code>gcloud app deploy</code> is all you need to push to production (doesn't require a git commit, interestingly enough. <code>gcloud app browse</code> will open you newly deployed app, and <code>gcloud app logs tail -s default</code> will display your logs when something goes horribly wrong.</p><p>And there you have it: the practical and completely cynical guide to embracing modern architecture. Join us next time when we pay 50 dollars to deploy a single-click app simply because we're too lazy or unmotivated to set anything up ourselves.</p>","url":"https://hackersandslackers.com/deploy-app-containters-with-gcp-app-engine/","uuid":"70f7a025-6774-4555-9eff-e63eb40c4fdf","page":false,"codeinjection_foot":"","codeinjection_head":"","comment_id":"5bd10e9e4ba34679679904f2"}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c12d7bfe875ad7bb867372e","title":"MySQL, Google Cloud, and a REST API that Generates Itself","slug":"mysql-google-cloud-and-a-rest-api-that-autogenerates","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://hackersandslackers.com/content/images/2018/10/mysqlagain2@2x.jpg","excerpt":"Deploy a MySQL database that auto-creates endpoints for itself.","custom_excerpt":"Deploy a MySQL database that auto-creates endpoints for itself.","created_at_pretty":"23 October, 2018","published_at_pretty":"23 October, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"02 February, 2019","created_at":"2018-10-23T14:57:12.000-04:00","published_at":"2018-10-23T18:47:28.000-04:00","updated_at":"2019-02-02T05:26:16.000-05:00","meta_title":"MySQL, Google Cloud, and a REST API | Hackers and Slackers","meta_description":"Create a MySQL database that makes its own endpoints for accessing and manipulating data.","og_description":"Create a MySQL database that makes its own endpoints for accessing and manipulating data.","og_image":"https://hackersandslackers.com/content/images/2018/10/mysqlagain2@2x.jpg","og_title":"MySQL, Google Cloud, and a REST API that Generates Itself","twitter_description":"Create a MySQL database that makes its own endpoints for accessing and manipulating data.","twitter_image":"https://hackersandslackers.com/content/images/2018/10/mysqlagain2@2x.jpg","twitter_title":"MySQL, Google Cloud, and a REST API that Generates Itself","authors":[{"name":"Todd Birchard","slug":"todd","bio":"Product manager turned engineer with an ongoing identity crisis.

This is why before moving forward, I'd like to be\ntransparent that this blog has become little more than thinly veiled Google\npropaganda, where I will henceforth bombard you with persuasive and subtle\nmessaging to sell your soul to Google. Let's be honest; they've probably\nsimulated it anyway.\n\nIt should be safe to assume that you're fairly familiar with AWS Lambda\nFunctions [https://hackersandslackers.com/creating-endpoints-with-lambda/],\nwhich have served as the backbone of what we refer to as \"serverless.\" These\ncode snippets in the cloud have restructured entire IT departments and are\npartially why almost nobody knows enough basic Linux to configure a web server\nor build anything without a vendor. In my opinion, Google Cloud Functions are\nbetter than that, so strap in.\n\nAWS vs GCP Comparison\nFirst off, let's talk about a big one: price. AWS charges based on Lambda usage,\nwhereas Google Cloud Functions are free. The only exception to this is when you\nbreak 2 million invocations/month, at which point you'll be hemorrhaging as\nghastly 40 cents per additional million. That's ridiculous. I think we've just\ndiscovered Google Cloud's lead generation strategy.\n\nWhat about in terms of workflow? AWS holds an architecture philosophy of\nchaining services together, into what inevitably becomes a web of self-contained\nbillable items on your invoice. A fine illustration of this is a fine post on \ncommon AWS patterns\n[https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-microservice-patterns-for-aws/]  which\nprovides a decent visual of this complexity, while also revealing how much\npeople apparently love this kind of shit, as though SaaS is the new Legos. To\ninteract with a Lambda function in AWS via HTTP requests, you need to set up an\nAPI Gateway in front. I hate setting up API Gateways: it's a feat more\nconvoluted and difficult than actually coding. Pair this with an inevitable user\npermission struggle just to get the right Lambda roles set up, and you quickly\nhave yourself a nightmare- especially  if you're just trying to get a single\nfunction live.  Eventually you’ll get to write some code or upload a horrendous\nzip file like some sort of neanderthal (friendly reminder: I am entirely\nbiased).\n\nGCP has clearly been taking notes on the sidelines on how to improve this\nprocess by removing red tape around service setup or policy configuration. AWS\nand GCP are tackling opposites approaches; AWS allows you to build a Robust API\ncomplete with staging and testing with the intent that some of these APIs can\neven be sold as standalone products to consumers. GCP takes the opposite\napproach: cloud functions are services intended for developers to develop, which\ncovers the vast majority of use cases in my opinion.\n\nCloud Function Deployment\nTo create our first function to serve as an endpoint, we'll utilize the\nfollowing:\n\n * A new Cloud Function  running Python 3.7\n * Google's Source Repositories: AKA a Github/Bitbucket clone with auto-syncing\n   to your real repos, along with direct access to GCP services (think Heroku's\n   source control).\n * The gcloud  CLI to enable us to work locally.\n\nYou should immediately notice the glaring lack of any mentions of API endpoints,\nmethods, stages, or anything related to handling web requests. It should not be\nunderstated that Cloud Functions are preconfigured with an endpoint, and all\nnonsense regarding whether endpoints accept GET or POST or AUTH or OPTIONs is\nmissing entirely. These things are handled in the function itself, and because\nGoogle Cloud functions running Python are preconfigured with Flask, all of that\nstuff is really trivially easy.  That's right, we've got Flask, Python,  and GCP \n all in a single post. Typing these words feels like eating cake while Dwyane\nThe Rock Johnson reads me bedtime stories and caresses me as I fall asleep. It's\ngreat.\n\nCreate your Function\nOur function will intend to serve as a Python HTTP endpoint:\n\nSingle-page setup. Easy. * Trigger  specifies what will have access to this function. By selecting HTTP,\n   we will immediately receive a URL.\n * Source code  gives us a few options to deploy our code with cloud source\n   repository  being by far the easiest solution, especially when working\n   locally.\n * Runtime  allows you to select NodeJS by accident.\n\nBefore we get to code, let's talk Python libraries.\n\nIncluding Dependencies in your Function\nOur function comes prepared with two files: main.py  and our friend \nrequirements.txt. These files do exactly what you'd expect, as per every project\never:\n\nUnfortunately, ease-of-use ensures that GCP certifications will be in low\ndemand.Our function immediately installs all dependencies in requirements.txt  for use\nupon deployment. Once deployed, we can import these libraries as expected. So,\nlet's deploy something.\n\nGoogle Source Repositories\nGoogle's source repositories can serve as a stand-in replacement for Github\n(unlikely), or auto-sync to any repo on the version control behemoth of your\nchoice. The advantage of this extra layer is mostly to trigger deployments upon\ncommits, which in turn feed into GCP's own CI/CD processes (which remain young\nfor now). Create a repo locally using gcloud:\n\n$ gcloud source repos create real-repo\n$ cd myproject/\n$ git init\n--------------------------------------------------------\n(take a moment to write or save some actual code here)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n$ git add --all\n$ git remote add google https://source.developers.google.com/p/hackers/r/real-repo\n$ git commit -m 'cheesey init message'\n$ git push --all google\n\n\nNow make that puppy go live with gcloud functions deploy totally-dope-function,\nwhere totally-dope-function  is name of your function, as it should be.\n\nNow let's get to the coding part.\n\nThe Coding Part (ft. Flask)\nHere's perhaps the most basic endpoint you'll ever create:\n\nimport requests\n\ndef endpoint(request):\n    \"\"\"Does the things.\"\"\"\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n    # Allows POST requests from any origin with the Content-Type\n    # header and caches preflight response for an 3600s\n    headers = {\n        'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',\n        'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'POST',\n        'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type',\n        'Access-Control-Max-Age': '3600'\n    }\n    request_json = request.get_json()\n    if request_json:\n        plaintext = request_json['plain']\n        html = request_json['html']\n        return html\n    else:\n        return 'You didn't pass a JSON body you idiot.'\n\n\nIf you're familiar with Flask (you are, because you're on this blog) you already\nknow what all of this does. Look at that simple copy-paste of headers, as\nopposed to working them into a horrible web interface. Gasp in disbelief as you\nrealize that typing if request.method == 'POST':  would be a 10-minute task in a\nvisual API building tool. We've made it fam.\n\nEase of Logging\nBecause we have a real endpoint to work with, we don't need to waste any time\nsimulating stupid fucking tests where we send fake JSON to our function. We can\nuse postman or anything to immediately interact with our endpoint, and the logs\nare a click away:\n\nEasy. Breezy. Beautiful.There's no point in me droning on at this point because\nyou've surely already ventured into the Google Cloud console in blissful\ndisbelief as a good obedient drone would. If adopting Google Cloud is the last\nshred of hope we have to resist Google's all-knowing algorithms which have\nalready replaced the illusion of free will, I'd gladly take that dystopia over\nsetting up monolithic API Gateways any day.\n\nThe Downsides\nTime for the asterisks to kill that euphoric buzz you might've experienced for a\nbrief moment. My sole purpose as an engineer is to have my dreams crushed\nfull-time; I simply cant resist returning the favor.\n\nFirst notable drawback of Cloud functions is a lack of out-of-the-box custom DNS \n configuration. Firebase has workarounds for this, but Firebase is a beast of\nits own.\n\nWhen it comes to debugging, functions tend to fall short in comparison to their\nLambda rivals. Most Cloud Function debugging involves deploying, testing in dev,\nand sifting through cryptic error logs (they can be quite bad). There's nearly\nno UI mock testing  to speak of. You'd better brush up on PyTest.\n\nMy best advice is to be careful with what services you play around with on GCP.\nLet's not forget this is a platform geared exclusively towards enterprises; the\nfact that we're even playing ball here makes us weirdos in the first place.\nDon't let yourself hemorrhage money like an enterprise.","html":"<p>The more I explore Google Cloud's endless catalog of cloud services, the more I really like Google Cloud. This is why before moving forward, I'd like to be transparent that this blog has become little more than thinly veiled Google propaganda, where I will henceforth bombard you with persuasive and subtle messaging to sell your soul to Google. Let's be honest; they've probably simulated it anyway.</p><p>It should be safe to assume that you're fairly familiar with AWS <a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/creating-endpoints-with-lambda/\">Lambda Functions</a>, which have served as the backbone of what we refer to as \"serverless.\" These code snippets in the cloud have restructured entire IT departments and are partially why almost nobody knows enough basic Linux to configure a web server or build anything without a vendor. In my opinion, Google Cloud Functions are better than <em>that</em>, so strap in.</p><h2 id=\"aws-vs-gcp-comparison\">AWS vs GCP Comparison</h2><p>First off, let's talk about a big one: price. AWS charges based on Lambda usage, whereas Google Cloud Functions are <strong>free</strong>. The only exception to this is when you break 2 million invocations/month, at which point you'll be hemorrhaging as ghastly <strong>40 cents per additional million. </strong>That's ridiculous. I think we've just discovered Google Cloud's lead generation strategy.</p><p>What about in terms of workflow? AWS holds an architecture philosophy of chaining services together, into what inevitably becomes a web of self-contained billable items on your invoice. A fine illustration of this is a fine post on <a href=\"https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-microservice-patterns-for-aws/\">common AWS patterns</a> which provides a decent visual of this complexity, while also revealing how much people apparently love this kind of shit, as though SaaS is the new Legos. To interact with a Lambda function in AWS via HTTP requests, you need to set up an API Gateway in front. I hate setting up API Gateways: it's a feat more convoluted and difficult than actually coding. Pair this with an inevitable user permission struggle just to get the right Lambda roles set up, and you quickly have yourself a nightmare- <em>especially</em> if you're just trying to get a single function live.<em> </em>Eventually you’ll get to write some code or upload a horrendous zip file like some sort of neanderthal (friendly reminder: I am entirely biased).</p><p>GCP has clearly been taking notes on the sidelines on how to improve this process by removing red tape around service setup or policy configuration. AWS and GCP are tackling opposites approaches; AWS allows you to build a Robust API complete with staging and testing with the intent that some of these APIs can even be sold as standalone products to consumers. GCP takes the opposite approach: cloud functions are services intended for developers to develop, which covers the vast majority of use cases in my opinion.</p><h2 id=\"cloud-function-deployment\">Cloud Function Deployment</h2><p>To create our first function to serve as an endpoint, we'll utilize the following:</p><ul><li>A new <strong>Cloud Function</strong> running Python 3.7</li><li>Google's <strong>Source Repositories: </strong>AKA a Github/Bitbucket clone with auto-syncing to your real repos, along with direct access to GCP services (think Heroku's source control).</li><li>The <strong>gcloud</strong> CLI to enable us to work locally.</li></ul><p>You should immediately notice the glaring lack of any mentions of API endpoints, methods, stages, or anything related to handling web requests. It should not be understated that <em>Cloud Functions are preconfigured with an endpoint</em>, and all nonsense regarding whether endpoints accept GET or POST or AUTH or OPTIONs is missing entirely. These things are handled in the function itself, and because Google Cloud functions running Python are preconfigured with <strong>Flask, </strong>all of that stuff is <em>really trivially easy.</em> That's right, we've got <em>Flask</em>, <em>Python</em>,<em> </em>and <em>GCP</em> all in a single post.

All logic lives in the root directory. We're in our 30s and the app\nwe've just created looks as terrible as our bathrooms. It's time to get our shit\ntogether.\n\nThe Flask Application Factory\nThe overwhelming preference to start a Flask application is to use a structure\ndubbed the Application Factory\n[http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/patterns/appfactories/]. The gist is to keep\nthe initialization preferences of our application in a single __init__.py  file,\nsometimes borrowing help from peer files such as db.py  or models.py. Either\nway, the gist is to keep global logic separated from the other parts.\n\nA simple app using the application factory method might look something like\nthis:\n\n[app]\n├── myapp/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── db.py\n│   ├── forms.py\n│   ├── models.py\n│   ├── views.py\n│   ├── static/\n│   └── templates/\n├── config.py\n├── requirements.txt\n├── setup.py\n├── Pipfile\n├── Pipfile.lock\n├── README.md\n├── app.json\n└── wsgi.py\n\n\nThe main takeaway here being the presence of the myapp  directory which now\nhouses our app logic, and the presence of our good friend __init__.py.\n\nAn example of what might live in __init.py__  could be something like this:\n\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom flask import Flask, g\nfrom config import BaseConfig\nfrom flask_login import LoginManager\nfrom flask_pymongo import PyMongo\n\n\ndef create_app():\n    app = Flask(__name__, instance_relative_config=True)\n    app.config.from_object('config.BaseConfig')\n    login = LoginManager()\n\n    with app.app_context():\n        from . import views\n        from . import auth\n        login.init_app(app)\n        mongo = PyMongo(app, app.config['MONGO_URI'])\n        app.register_blueprint(views.main)\n        app.register_blueprint(admin.admin)\n\n        return app\n\n\nHere we initialize our app and the dependencies we'd like to initialize within a\nsingle function. Most familiar might be the first two lines of our function: The\nfirst creating our app object, and the second loading a config from a class in a\nconfig file.\n\nAnother common practice is to keep libraries which need to run init_app  in this\nfile as well. This could be something like the LoginManager  seen in the example\nabove, or a global database configuration. Lastly, this is also where we would\nregister any Blueprints  as well.\n\nUsing Blueprints in Flask\nWhile the Application Factory is an excellent first step to building cohesive\napps, we haven't solved the problem of organizing our app into separation of\nconcerns. Blueprints  are a way for us to separate our app into parts which\nshare very little with one another. Prime examples would include apps with an \nadmin  panel with an accompanying client-facing  side, or apps where the \"logged\nin\" state is vastly different from the app's \"logged out\"  state. In these\ncases, it seems silly to mix both logic and static assets into a single lump,\nwhich is where Blueprints come in.\n\nNOTE:  If you're a Django person and this is all starting to sound familiar,\nthat's because we can equate Flask's Blueprints  to Django's concept of apps. \nThere are differences and added flexibility, but the concept remains the same.\n\nRegistering a part of your app as a Blueprint begins with the following two\nlines:\n\nfrom flask import Blueprint\n\nauth = Blueprint('auth', __name__)\n\n\nWhen we registered the admin  Blueprint previously in __init__.py, the line \napp.register_blueprint(admin.admin)  is essentially saying \"look for a Blueprint \n named admin  in a module (either file or folder structure) called admin.\"  It's\nimportant not to overlook the concept that Blueprints can either be single files\nor entirely standalone file structures with their own templates and static\nfiles.  For instance, a Flask app with completely decoupled Blueprints might be\nstructured as follows:\n\n[app]\n├── myapp/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── admin/\n│   │    ├── __init__.py\n│   │    ├── views.py\n│   │    ├── forms.py\n│   │    ├── static/\n│   │\t └── templates/\n│   ├── frontend/\n│   │    ├── __init__.py\n│   │    ├── views.py\n│   │    ├── forms.py\n│   │    ├── static/\n│   │\t └── templates/  \n│   ├── db.py\n│   ├── forms.py\n│   ├── models.py\n│   └── views.py\n├── config.py\n├── requirements.txt\n├── setup.py\n├── Pipfile\n├── Pipfile.lock\n├── README.md\n├── app.json\n└── wsgi.py\n        \n\n\nIn the case above, each Blueprint  stands as though it were its own Python\nmodule. Each blueprint contains its own logic, templates, and static files -\npresumably encapsulated in a way which makes sense.\n\nUsing Flask-Assets with Blueprints\nWe've already forced a lot of information down your throat, but there's one last\nthing worth mentioning in this overview of working with Blueprints, which is\nworking with assets. We've previously looked at the Flask-Static-Compress \nlibrary for static asset management, but Blueprints  lend themselves better to \nFlask-Assets  way of thinking.\n\nFlask-Assets  is a library which creates a bundle (aka compressed) of assets\nupfront. Thus, the start of a Blueprint definition might now look something like\nthis:\n\nfrom flask import Blueprint\nfrom flask_assets import Environment, Bundle, build\nimport sass\n\nauth = Blueprint('admin', __name__)\n\nassets = Environment(admin)\nscss = Bundle('scss/main.scss', 'scss/forms.scss', filters='libsass', output='build/css/style.css')\nassets.register('scss_all', scss)\nscss.build()\n\n\nEnvironment  states the context of our asset bundle, which is admin, the current\nBlueprint. \n\nBundle  takes any number of files to compressed together as arguments. Then we\nmust pass the type of \"filter\" the assets are (typically a precompiler) and of\ncourse an output destination for the Bundle.\n\n.register()  registers the bundle we just created, not unlike the way we\nregistered our Blueprint.\n\n.build()  must be called explicitly in order to build the bundle at runtime.\nConversely, we could intentionally exclude .build()  if we expect our assets are\nnot to change.\n\nAnd Now You Know Everything\n...or not, really. The most we should take from this post is:\n\n * There's a better way to structure our apps.\n * There are many potential decisions we can make about the structure of our\n   app.\n * There's way more stuff we need to Google or look up on StackOverflow.\n\nTruthfully, there are plenty of resources within Flask's documentation\n[http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/views/#]  or around the internet that\ncovers the topic of Flask app organization and its granular topics more than\nthis single post could ever hope to. Nonetheless, here's to hoping you're\nfeeling a sense of direction in these crazy, adult lives of ours.","html":"<p>When we first started developing in Flask, most of us took the 5 lines of code in the quick-start guide and ran with it.

Prime examples would include apps with an <em>admin</em> panel with an accompanying <em>client-facing</em> side, or apps where the \"<em>logged in\" </em>state is vastly different from the app's \"<em>logged out\"</em> state. In these cases, it seems silly to mix both logic and static assets into a single lump, which is where Blueprints come in.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you're a Django person and this is all starting to sound familiar, that's because we can equate Flask's <strong>Blueprints</strong> to Django's concept of <strong>apps.</strong> There are differences and added flexibility, but the concept remains the same.</p><p>Registering a part of your app as a Blueprint begins with the following two lines:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Blueprint\n\nauth = Blueprint('auth', __name__)\n</code></pre>\n<p>When we registered the <code>admin</code> Blueprint previously in <code>__init__.py</code>, the line <code>app.register_blueprint(admin.admin)</code> is essentially saying \"look for a <strong>Blueprint</strong> named <em>admin</em> in a module (either file or folder structure) called <em>admin.\"</em> It's important not to overlook the concept that Blueprints can either be single files or <em>entirely standalone file structures with their own templates and static files.</em> For instance, a Flask app with completely decoupled Blueprints might be structured as follows:</p><pre><code class=\"language-shell\">[app]\n├── myapp/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── admin/\n│   │    ├── __init__.py\n│   │    ├── views.py\n│   │    ├── forms.py\n│   │    ├── static/\n│   │\t └── templates/\n│   ├── frontend/\n│   │    ├── __init__.py\n│   │    ├── views.py\n│   │    ├── forms.py\n│   │    ├── static/\n│   │\t └── templates/  \n│   ├── db.py\n│   ├── forms.py\n│   ├── models.py\n│   └── views.py\n├── config.py\n├── requirements.txt\n├── setup.py\n├── Pipfile\n├── Pipfile.lock\n├── README.md\n├── app.json\n└── wsgi.py\n        \n</code></pre>\n<p>In the case above, each <strong>Blueprint</strong> stands as though it were its own Python module. Each blueprint contains its own logic, templates, and static files - presumably encapsulated in a way which makes sense.</p><h2 id=\"using-flask-assets-with-blueprints\">Using Flask-Assets with Blueprints</h2><p>We've already forced a lot of information down your throat, but there's one last thing worth mentioning in this overview of working with <strong>Blueprints, </strong>which is working with assets. We've previously looked at the <code>Flask-Static-Compress</code> library for static asset management, but <strong>Blueprints</strong> lend themselves better to <code>Flask-Assets</code> way of thinking.</p><p><code>Flask-Assets</code> is a library which creates a bundle (aka compressed) of assets upfront. Thus, the start of a Blueprint definition might now look something like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-shell\">from flask import Blueprint\nfrom flask_assets import Environment, Bundle, build\nimport sass\n\nauth = Blueprint('admin', __name__)\n\nassets = Environment(admin)\nscss = Bundle('scss/main.scss', 'scss/forms.scss', filters='libsass', output='build/css/style.css')\nassets.register('scss_all', scss)\nscss.build()\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>Environment</code> states the context of our asset bundle, which is admin, the current Blueprint. </p><p><code>Bundle</code> takes any number of files to compressed together as arguments. Then we must pass the type of \"filter\" the assets are (typically a precompiler) and of course an output destination for the Bundle.</p><p><code>.register()</code> registers the bundle we just created, not unlike the way we registered our Blueprint.</p><p><code>.build()</code> must be called explicitly in order to build the bundle at runtime. Conversely, we could intentionally exclude <code>.build()</code> if we expect our assets are not to change.</p><h2 id=\"and-now-you-know-everything\">And Now You Know Everything</h2><p>...or not, really. The most we should take from this post is:</p><ul><li>There's a better way to structure our apps.</li><li>There are many potential decisions we can make about the structure of our app.</li><li>There's way more stuff we need to Google or look up on StackOverflow.</li></ul><p>Truthfully, there are plenty of resources within <a href=\"http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/views/#\">Flask's documentation</a> or around the internet that covers the topic of Flask app organization and its granular topics more than this single post could ever hope to.

There's an API you're working with, and\nit's great. It contains all the information you're looking for, but there's just\none problem: the complexity of nested JSON objects is endless, and suddenly the\njob you love needs to be put on hold to painstakingly retrieve the data you\nactually want, and it's 5 levels deep in a nested JSON hell. Nobody feels like\nmuch of a \"scientist\" or an \"engineer\" when half their day becomes dealing with\nkey value errors.\n\nLuckily, we code in Python!  (okay fine, language doesn't make much of a\ndifference here. It felt like a rallying call at the time).\n\nUsing Google Maps API as an Example\nTo visualize the problem, let's take an example somebody might actually want to\nuse.  I think the  Google Maps API is a good candidate to fit the bill here.\n\nWhile Google Maps is actually a collection of APIs, the Google Maps Distance\nMatrix [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/start].\nThe idea is that with a single API call, a user can calculate the distance and\ntime traveled between an origin and an infinite number of destinations. It's a\ngreat full-featured API, but as you might imagine the resulting JSON for\ncalculating commute time between where you stand and every location in the\nconceivable universe  makes an awfully complex JSON structure.\n\nGetting a Taste of JSON Hell\nReal quick, here's an example of the types of parameters this request accepts:\n\nimport requests\nimport API_KEY\n\ndef google_api_matrix():\n    \"\"\"Example Google Distance Matrix function.\"\"\"\n    endpoint = \"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json\"\n    params = {\n       'units': 'imperial',\n       'key': API_KEY,\n       'origins': 'New York City, NY',\n       'destinations': 'Philadelphia,PA',\n       'transit_mode': 'car'\n    }\n    r = requests.get(endpoint, params=params)\n    return r.json\n\n\nOne origin, one destination. The JSON response for a request this\nstraightforward is quite simple:\n\n{\n    \"destination_addresses\": [\n        \"Philadelphia, PA, USA\"\n    ],\n    \"origin_addresses\": [\n        \"New York, NY, USA\"\n    ],\n    \"rows\": [\n        {\n            \"elements\": [\n                {\n                    \"distance\": {\n                        \"text\": \"94.6 mi\",\n                        \"value\": 152193\n                    },\n                    \"duration\": {\n                        \"text\": \"1 hour 44 mins\",\n                        \"value\": 6227\n                    },\n                    \"status\": \"OK\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ],\n    \"status\": \"OK\"\n}\n\n\nFor each destination, we're getting two data points: the commute distance, and \nestimated duration. If we hypothetically wanted to extract those values, typing \nresponse['rows'][0]['elements']['distance']['test']  isn't too  crazy. I mean,\nit's somewhat awful and brings on casual thoughts of suicide, but nothing out of\nthe ordinary\n\nNow let's make things interesting by adding a few more stops on our trip:\n\nimport requests \nimport API_KEY\n\ndef google_api_matrix():\n    \"\"\"Example Google Distance Matrix function.\"\"\"\n    endpoint = \"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json\"\n    params = {\n       'units': 'imperial',\n       'key': API_KEY,\n       'origins': 'New York City, NY',\n       'destinations': 'Washington,DC|Philadelphia,PA|Santa Barbara,CA|Miami,FL|Austin,TX|Napa County,CA',\n       'transit_mode': 'car'\n    }\n    r = requests.get(endpoint, params=params)\n    return r.json\n\n\nOh fuuucckkkk:\n\n{\n  \"destination_addresses\": [\n    \"Washington, DC, USA\",\n    \"Philadelphia, PA, USA\",\n    \"Santa Barbara, CA, USA\",\n    \"Miami, FL, USA\",\n    \"Austin, TX, USA\",\n    \"Napa County, CA, USA\"\n  ],\n  \"origin_addresses\": [\n    \"New York, NY, USA\"\n  ],\n  \"rows\": [\n    {\n      \"elements\": [\n        {\n          \"distance\": {\n            \"text\": \"227 mi\",\n            \"value\": 365468\n          },\n          \"duration\": {\n            \"text\": \"3 hours 54 mins\",\n            \"value\": 14064\n          },\n          \"status\": \"OK\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"distance\": {\n            \"text\": \"94.6 mi\",\n            \"value\": 152193\n          },\n          \"duration\": {\n            \"text\": \"1 hour 44 mins\",\n            \"value\": 6227\n          },\n          \"status\": \"OK\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"distance\": {\n            \"text\": \"2,878 mi\",\n            \"value\": 4632197\n          },\n          \"duration\": {\n            \"text\": \"1 day 18 hours\",\n            \"value\": 151772\n          },\n          \"status\": \"OK\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"distance\": {\n            \"text\": \"1,286 mi\",\n            \"value\": 2069031\n          },\n          \"duration\": {\n            \"text\": \"18 hours 43 mins\",\n            \"value\": 67405\n          },\n          \"status\": \"OK\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"distance\": {\n            \"text\": \"1,742 mi\",\n            \"value\": 2802972\n          },\n          \"duration\": {\n            \"text\": \"1 day 2 hours\",\n            \"value\": 93070\n          },\n          \"status\": \"OK\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"distance\": {\n            \"text\": \"2,871 mi\",\n            \"value\": 4620514\n          },\n          \"duration\": {\n            \"text\": \"1 day 18 hours\",\n            \"value\": 152913\n          },\n          \"status\": \"OK\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"status\": \"OK\"\n}\n\n\nA lot is happening here. There are objects. There are lists. There are lists of\nobjects which are part of an object. The last thing I'd want to deal with is\ntrying to parse this data only to accidentally get a useless key:value pair like\n \"status\": \"OK\".\n\nCode Snippet To The Rescue\nLet's say we only want the human-readable data from this JSON, which is labeled \n\"text\"  for both distance and duration. We've created a function below dubbed \nextract_values()  to help us resolve this very issue. The idea is that \nextract_values()  is flexible and agnostic, therefore can be imported as a\nmodule into any project you might need.\n\n# recursivejson.py\n\ndef extract_values(obj, key):\n    \"\"\"Pull all values of specified key from nested JSON.\"\"\"\n    arr = []\n\n    def extract(obj, arr, key):\n        \"\"\"Recursively search for values of key in JSON tree.\"\"\"\n        if isinstance(obj, dict):\n            for k, v in obj.items():\n                if isinstance(v, (dict, list)):\n                    extract(v, arr, key)\n                elif k == key:\n                    arr.append(v)\n        elif isinstance(obj, list):\n            for item in obj:\n                extract(item, arr, key)\n        return arr\n\n    results = extract(obj, arr, key)\n    return results\n\n\nWe need to pass this function two values:\n\n * A JSON object, such as r.json()  from an API request.\n * The name of the key  we're looking to extract values from.\n\nnames = extract_values('myjson.json', 'name')\nprint(names)\n\n\nRegardless of where the key \"text\"  lives in the JSON, this function returns\nevery value for the instance of \"key.\" Here's our function in action:\n\nimport requests\nimport API_KEY\nfrom recursivejson import extract_values\n\n\ndef google_api_matrix():\n    \"\"\"Example Google Distance Matrix function.\"\"\"\n    endpoint = \"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json\"\n    params = {\n       'units': 'imperial',\n       'key': API_KEY,\n       'origins': \"New York City,NY\",\n       'destinations': \"Washington,DC|Philadelphia,PA|Santa Barbara,CA|Miami,FL|Austin,TX|Napa Valley,CA\",\n       'transit_mode': 'car',\n    }\n\n   r = requests.get(endpoint, params=params)\n   travel_values = extract_values(r.json(), 'text')\n   return travel_values\n\n\nRunning this function will result in the following output:\n\n['227 mi', '3 hours 54 mins', '94.6 mi', '1 hour 44 mins', '2,878 mi', '1 day 18 hours', '1,286 mi', '18 hours 43 mins', '1,742 mi', '1 day 2 hours', '2,871 mi', '1 day 18 hours']\n\n\nOh fiddle me timbers! Because the Google API alternates between distance and \ntrip duration, every other value alternates between distance and time (can we\npause to appreciate this horrible design? There are infinitely better ways to\nstructure this response). Never fear, some simple Python can help us split this\nlist into two lists:\n\nmy_values = extract_values(r.json(), 'text')\n\ndurations = my_values[1::2]\ndistances = my_values[2::1]\n\nprint('DURATIONS = ', durations)\nprint('DISTANCES = ', distances)\n\n\nThis will take our one list and split it in to two  lists, alternating between\neven and odd:\n\nDURATIONS = ['3 hours 54 mins', '1 hour 44 mins', '1 day 18 hours', '18 hours 43 mins', '1 day 2 hours', '1 day 18 hours']\nDISTANCES = ['94.6 mi', '1 hour 44 mins', '2,878 mi', '1 day 18 hours', '1,286 mi', '18 hours 43 mins', '1,742 mi', '1 day 2 hours', '2,871 mi', '1 day 18 hours']\n\n\nGetting Creative With Lists\nA common theme I run in to while extracting lists of values from JSON objects\nlike these is that the lists of values I extract are very much related.  In the\nabove example, for every duration  we have an accompanying distance, which is a\none-to-one basis. Imagine if we wanted to associate these values somehow?\n\nTo use a better example, I recently I used this exact_values()  function to\nextract lists of column names and their data types from a database schema. As\nseparate lists, the data looked something like this:\n\ncolumn_names = ['index', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'join_date']\ncolumn_datatypes = ['integer', 'string', 'string', 'date']\n\n\nClearly these two lists are directly related; the latter is describing the\nformer. How can this be useful? By using Python's zip  method!\n\nschema_dict = dict(zip(column_names, column_datatypes))\nprint(schema_dict)\n\n\nI like to think they call it zip  because it's like zipping up a zipper, where\neach side of the zipper is a list. This output a dictionary where list 1 serves\nas the keys, and list 2 serves as values:\n\n{\n'index': 'integer', \n'first_name': 'string', \n'last_name':'string',\n'join_date': 'date'\n}\n\n\nAnd there you have it folks: a free code snippet to copy and secretly pretend\nyou wrote forever. I've thrown the function up on Github Gists\n[https://gist.github.com/toddbirchard/b6f86f03f6cf4fc9492ad4349ee7ff8b], if such\na thing pleases you.\n\nIn the meantime, zip it up and zip it out.

We've created a function below dubbed <code>extract_values()</code> to help us resolve this very issue. The idea is that <code>extract_values()</code> is flexible and agnostic, therefore can be imported as a module into any project you might need.</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\"># recursivejson.py\n\ndef extract_values(obj, key):\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;Pull all values of specified key from nested JSON.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n    arr = []\n\n    def extract(obj, arr, key):\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;Recursively search for values of key in JSON tree.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n        if isinstance(obj, dict):\n            for k, v in obj.items():\n                if isinstance(v, (dict, list)):\n                    extract(v, arr, key)\n                elif k == key:\n                    arr.append(v)\n        elif isinstance(obj, list):\n            for item in obj:\n                extract(item, arr, key)\n        return arr\n\n    results = extract(obj, arr, key)\n    return results\n</code></pre>\n<p>We need to pass this function two values:</p><ul><li>A JSON object, such as <code>r.json()</code> from an API request.</li><li>The name of the <strong>key</strong> we're looking to extract values from.</li></ul><pre><code class=\"language-python\">names = extract_values('myjson.json', 'name')\nprint(names)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Regardless of where the key <strong>\"text\"</strong> lives in the JSON, this function returns every value for the instance of <strong>\"key.\" </strong>Here's our function in action:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">import requests\nimport API_KEY\nfrom recursivejson import extract_values\n\n\ndef google_api_matrix():\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;Example Google Distance Matrix function.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n    endpoint = &quot;https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json&quot;\n    params = {\n       'units': 'imperial',\n       'key': API_KEY,\n       'origins': &quot;New York City,NY&quot;,\n       'destinations': &quot;Washington,DC|Philadelphia,PA|Santa Barbara,CA|Miami,FL|Austin,TX|Napa Valley,CA&quot;,\n       'transit_mode': 'car',\n    }\n\n   r = requests.get(endpoint, params=params)\n   travel_values = extract_values(r.json(), 'text')\n   return travel_values\n</code></pre>\n<p>Running this function will result in the following output:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">['227 mi', '3 hours 54 mins', '94.6 mi', '1 hour 44 mins', '2,878 mi', '1 day 18 hours', '1,286 mi', '18 hours 43 mins', '1,742 mi', '1 day 2 hours', '2,871 mi', '1 day 18 hours']\n</code></pre>\n<p>Oh <em>fiddle me timbers</em>! Because the Google API alternates between <strong>distance </strong>and <strong>trip duration</strong>, every other value alternates between distance and time (can we pause to appreciate this horrible design? There are infinitely better ways to structure this response). Never fear, some simple Python can help us split this list into two lists:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">my_values = extract_values(r.json(), 'text')\n\ndurations = my_values[1::2]\ndistances = my_values[2::1]\n\nprint('DURATIONS = ', durations)\nprint('DISTANCES = ', distances)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will take our one list and split it in to <em>two</em> lists, alternating between even and odd:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">DURATIONS = ['3 hours 54 mins', '1 hour 44 mins', '1 day 18 hours', '18 hours 43 mins', '1 day 2 hours', '1 day 18 hours']\nDISTANCES = ['94.6 mi', '1 hour 44 mins', '2,878 mi', '1 day 18 hours', '1,286 mi', '18 hours 43 mins', '1,742 mi', '1 day 2 hours', '2,871 mi', '1 day 18 hours']\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"getting-creative-with-lists\">Getting Creative With Lists</h2><p>A common theme I run in to while extracting lists of values from JSON objects like these is that the lists of values I extract are very much related.  In the above example, for every <em>duration</em> we have an accompanying <em>distance, </em>which is a one-to-one basis. Imagine if we wanted to associate these values somehow?</p><p>To use a better example, I recently I used this <code>exact_values()</code> function to extract lists of column names and their data types from a database schema. As separate lists, the data looked something like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">column_names = ['index', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'join_date']\ncolumn_datatypes = ['integer', 'string', 'string', 'date']\n</code></pre>\n<p>Clearly these two lists are directly related; the latter is describing the former. How can this be useful? By using Python's <code>zip</code> method!</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">schema_dict = dict(zip(column_names, column_datatypes))\nprint(schema_dict)\n</code></pre>\n<p>I like to think they call it <em>zip</em> because it's like zipping up a zipper, where each side of the zipper is a list. This output a dictionary where list 1 serves as the keys, and list 2 serves as values:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">{\n'index': 'integer', \n'first_name': 'string', \n'last_name':'string',\n'join_date': 'date'\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And there you have it folks: a free code snippet to copy and secretly pretend you wrote forever. I've thrown the function up on <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/toddbirchard/b6f86f03f6cf4fc9492ad4349ee7ff8b\">Github Gists</a>, if such a thing pleases you.</p><p>In the meantime, zip it up and zip it out.

This is made evident by the\npresence of the word \"Gulp\" present throughout the post.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs you may have already deduced from the occasional glaring holes in my\nprogramming knowledge, I haven’t spent as much of my life programming than,\nwell, anybody who haphazardly threw away an 8-year product management career.\nApparently, a lot can happen in 8 years... especially when it comes to\nJavaScript.\nPutting aside that whole server-side  NodeJS thing or whatever it’s called,\nthere’s years worth of mindfucks for those of us who fairly recently returned to\ndev. In our absence, the world has been Grunting, Gulping, Yarning and even\nNPMing. Let’s assume we’ve gotten past all of that... phew. Oh wait, I forgot to\nmention the monstrosity of “hey by way there’s this mess of a hardly-explained\n(protocol? organization? Fancy Github Repo?) called Babel that we all depend on\nto do meaningful shit in the browser these days.”\n\nIf you’re here because you’re trying to figure what the hell all these ‘const’\nand ‘import’ keywords are doing in modern-day browser JavaScript, consider this\nhalf focus-group and half getting-started tutorial. For the rest of you\nexperienced JS devs out there, perhaps you should stay. No, by all means, I’d\nlike you to sit here and think about the kind of ecosystem you’ve decided to\npatch together. Do it; otherwise, I might just give Kik a call to see what other\ntiny NPM modules they’d like to arbitrarily demand the removal of... remember\nthat? Exactly. Now think about what you’ve done.\n\nECMAScript and the Backwards-Compatible Web\nAny Actionscript veterans in the house? No? Just me? Great. Anyway, There’s\nsomething that ActionScript, JavaScript, and a bunch of Whatever-scripts have in\ncommon: they’re all implementations of ECMAScript: the ancestral equivalent of\ncomparing Latin to Spanish or French, but just one added detail: ECMAScript is\nstill a living language, and constantly improving. If some nation of cool cats\nstill spoke Latin as an active language and were constantly coming up with sick\nnew slang terms, those speaking French or Spanish would be powerless to come up\nwith phrases nearly as cool as “lit” or \"fam\"  (or whatever those Latin\nequivalents would be).\n\nThe problem is web browsers are inherently backward-compatible monstrosities.\nMost revenue-generating companies look at their >5% user base using Internet\nExplorer three and a half, and think “oh my god, that’s five percent of our\npotential revenue” (it isn’t, but whatever). That’s where we stand.\n\nNew features? For the INTERNET?\nI remember one particular weekend I rented a hotel room for the sole purpose of\nwrapping up an app based on MongoDB Stitch at the time. I was pretty confident I\nhad it all figured out, but found, something about Mongo’s quick start guides\nfelt off (I mean, more off than the rest of their nearly unreadable docs). Why\ndid Mongo insist on inline JavaScript? Haven’t we evolved past the days where\nPHP, HTML, CSS, and JS all lived on the same page?\n\nAs everybody-who-wasn’t-me at time already knows, JavaScript has been reaping\nthe benefits of new evolutions in ECMAScript over the years, but there’s a\ncatch: only the most modern browsers know what the hell to do with these new\nfeatures (duh), and they only do so with the dreaded  blocks thrown on HTML\npages. Attempting to use modern ECMA features in a linked JS file which hasn’t\nbeen pre-compiled is like dividing by zero. Seriously, you might die.\n\nBabel to the Rescue\nMore research only lead to more questions. Who is this Browserify wizard\n[http://browserify.org/]  and why is he dead? What is Webpack doing to fund all\ntheir highly produced branding, and why would anybody purchase a Webpack T-shirt\n[https://webpack.threadless.com/]? Finally, the biggest question of all: who the\nhell is this Babel guy who gives off as an electric explosion in your face on\nhard drugs?\n\nI can't even the difference between a compiler and a Marvel franchise anymore.I\nthink it was at this point in my journey of catching up on the last decade where\nI went truly mad and began pacing around my room, verbally assaulting inanimate\nobjects, and eventually even found myself washed up in a Wendys down the street,\nshivering and crying to myself. \n\nNow that I've been released from the psyche ward and are free to wander the\nstreets again, I've managed to piece together a bare-minimum understanding of\nwhat the hell is going on.\n\nWhat the Hell is Going On\nBecause Javascript as a language is destined to be backwards compatible to a\nyear when OJ Simpson was on trial and Windows 95 was considered cutting-edge\ntechnology, Babel  aims to \"improve\" browser Javascript. Because we can't\nactually improve or change the underlying technology, Babel looks at new-fangled\nECMA syntax (containing words like require,const  or promise) and compiles logic\nequivalent to these features with vanilla Javascript. If that sounds similar to\nhow Gulp  takes CSS preprocessors (like LESS  or SASS) and turns those files\ninto interpretable browser code, well, that's exactly what happens. \n\nGulp  is not be the only way to utilize new ECMAScript features. Babel syntax\ncan be compiled a number of ways, such as Babel's CLI\n[https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli], or from Server-side JS, or Webpack  if\nyou're Mister-Fancy-Pants. In fact, the trend across the board is that compiling\nyour site with modules via Webpack is winning dramatically. For all we know,\nthis could be the last Babel Gulp tutorial ever written.\n\nRight now we're focusing on the ability to use ECMAScript features on the\nfrontend; a common use-case for things like... well... theming the presentation\nlayer for a blog. If we can pull it off with Gulp, you probably won't struggle\nmuch with future methods.\n\nBabel NPM Packages\nAlright, so Babel isn't just a single NPM package. It's a lot. Let's see what's\nthere in a basic package.json:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"example\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"babel src -d lib\"\n  },\n  \"presets\": [\n    \"env\"\n  ],\n  \"engines\": {\n    \"node\": \"8.12.0\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@babel/polyfill\": \"^7.0.0\",\n    \"@babel/runtime\": \"^7.1.2\",\n    \"@babel/runtime-corejs2\": \"^7.1.2\",\n    \"babel-runtime\": \"^6.26.0\",\n    \"gulp-resolve-dependencies\": \"^2.2.0\",\n    \"gulp-sourcemaps\": \"^2.6.4\",\n    \"gulp-uglify-es\": \"^1.0.4\",\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@babel/cli\": \"^7.1.2\",\n    \"@babel/core\": \"^7.1.2\",\n    \"@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import\": \"^7.0.0\",\n    \"@babel/plugin-transform-runtime\": \"^7.1.0\",\n    \"@babel/preset-env\": \"^7.1.0\",\n  }\n}\n\nLet's not go through all these in detail- in fact, let's take a look at our \ngulpfile.js:\n\n'use strict';\n\nvar gulp = require('gulp'),\n  concat = require('gulp-concat'),\n  autoprefixer = require('gulp-autoprefixer'),\n  sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps'),\n  babel = require('gulp-babel'),\n  resolveDependencies = require('gulp-resolve-dependencies'),\n\n\nvar paths = {\n  scripts: {\n    src: 'src/js/*.js',\n    dest: 'assets/js'\n  }\n};\n\nfunction scripts() {\n  return gulp.src(paths.scripts.src)\n    .pipe(babel({\n          presets: ['@babel/env'],\n          plugins: ['@babel/transform-runtime', '@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import']\n    }))\n    .on('error', console.error.bind(console))\n    .pipe(resolveDependencies({\n            pattern: /\\* @requires [\\s-]*(.*\\.js)/g\n        }))\n    .pipe(concat('main.min.js'))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.scripts.dest));\n}\n\nNote that I've gone ahead and removed anything from the file that has nothing to\ndo with Babel - everything seen here is strictly relevant to building a\n'scripts' task. The gist is this:\n\nbabel  accepts two arrays:\n\n * Presets  refers to the version of ECMAScript we're targeting, and what we\n   have implies the latest.\n * Plugins  allow us to pass any plugins Babel supports; in this case, we're\n   rendering stuff at runtime. Let's not get into it too far.\n\nThe rest of the function is simple: we catch errors if any arise, we resolve\nrequired dependencies, and then we finally bunch everything into a single file\nand shove it in our destination folder.\n\nJust to be Clear\nWhen it comes to the best  way of achieving ECMAScript 2015 or 2016 etc in the\nbrowser,  I'm no expert.

This is made evident by the presence of the word \"Gulp\" present throughout the post.</p><hr><p>As you may have already deduced from the occasional glaring holes in my programming knowledge, I haven’t spent as much of my life programming than, well, anybody who haphazardly threw away an 8-year product management career. Apparently, a lot can happen in 8 years... especially when it comes to JavaScript.<br>Putting aside that whole server-side  NodeJS thing or whatever it’s called, there’s years worth of mindfucks for those of us who fairly recently returned to dev. In our absence, the world has been Grunting, Gulping, Yarning and even NPMing. Let’s assume we’ve gotten past all of that... phew. Oh wait, I forgot to mention the monstrosity of “hey by way there’s this mess of a hardly-explained (protocol? organization? Fancy Github Repo?) called Babel that we all depend on to do meaningful shit in the browser these days.”</p><p>If you’re here because you’re trying to figure what the hell all these ‘const’ and ‘import’ keywords are doing in modern-day browser JavaScript, consider this half focus-group and half getting-started tutorial. For the rest of you experienced JS devs out there, perhaps you should stay. No, by all means, I’d like you to sit here and think about the kind of ecosystem you’ve decided to patch together. Do it; otherwise, I might just give Kik a call to see what other tiny NPM modules they’d like to arbitrarily demand the removal of... remember that? Exactly. Now think about what you’ve done.</p><h2 id=\"ecmascript-and-the-backwards-compatible-web\">ECMAScript and the Backwards-Compatible Web</h2><p>Any Actionscript veterans in the house? No? Just me? Great. Anyway, There’s something that ActionScript, JavaScript, and a bunch of Whatever-scripts have in common: they’re all implementations of ECMAScript: the ancestral equivalent of comparing Latin to Spanish or French, but just one added detail: ECMAScript is still a living language, and constantly improving. If some nation of cool cats still spoke Latin as an active language and were constantly coming up with sick new slang terms, those speaking French or Spanish would be powerless to come up with phrases nearly as cool as “lit” or \"fam\"  (or whatever those Latin equivalents would be).</p><p>The problem is web browsers are inherently backward-compatible monstrosities. Most revenue-generating companies look at their &gt;5% user base using Internet Explorer three and a half, and think “oh my god, that’s five percent of our potential revenue” (it isn’t, but whatever). That’s where we stand.</p><h2 id=\"new-features-for-the-internet\">New features? For the INTERNET?</h2><p>I remember one particular weekend I rented a hotel room for the sole purpose of wrapping up an app based on MongoDB Stitch at the time. I was pretty confident I had it all figured out, but found, something about Mongo’s quick start guides felt off (I mean, more off than the rest of their nearly unreadable docs). Why did Mongo insist on inline JavaScript? Haven’t we evolved past the days where PHP, HTML, CSS, and JS all lived on the same page?</p><p>As everybody-who-wasn’t-me at time already knows, JavaScript has been reaping the benefits of new evolutions in ECMAScript over the years, but there’s a catch: only the most modern browsers know what the hell to do with these new features (duh), and they only do so with the dreaded  blocks thrown on HTML pages. Attempting to use modern ECMA features in a linked JS file which hasn’t been pre-compiled is like dividing by zero. Seriously, you might die.</p><h2 id=\"babel-to-the-rescue\">Babel to the Rescue</h2><p>More research only lead to more questions. Who is this <a href=\"http://browserify.org/\">Browserify wizard</a> and why is he dead? What is Webpack doing to fund all their highly produced branding, and why would anybody purchase a <a href=\"https://webpack.threadless.com/\">Webpack T-shirt</a>? Finally, the biggest question of all: who the hell is this Babel guy who gives off as an electric explosion in your face on hard drugs?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/babel2-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption><em>I can't even the difference between a compiler and a Marvel franchise anymore.&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure><p>I think it was at this point in my journey of catching up on the last decade where I went truly mad and began pacing around my room, verbally assaulting inanimate objects, and eventually even found myself washed up in a Wendys down the street, shivering and crying to myself. </p><p>Now that I've been released from the psyche ward and are free to wander the streets again, I've managed to piece together a bare-minimum understanding of what the hell is going on.</p><h3 id=\"what-the-hell-is-going-on\">What the Hell is Going On</h3><p>Because Javascript as a language is destined to be backwards compatible to a year when OJ Simpson was on trial and Windows 95 was considered cutting-edge technology, <strong>Babel</strong> aims to \"improve\" browser Javascript. Because we can't actually improve or change the underlying technology, Babel looks at new-fangled ECMA syntax (containing words like <code>require</code>,  <code>const</code> or <code>promise</code>) and compiles logic equivalent to these features with vanilla Javascript. If that sounds similar to how <strong>Gulp</strong> takes CSS preprocessors (like <em>LESS</em> or <em>SASS</em>) and turns those files into interpretable browser code, well, that's exactly what happens. </p><p><strong>Gulp</strong> is not be the only way to utilize new ECMAScript features. Babel syntax can be compiled a number of ways, such as <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli\">Babel's CLI</a>, or from Server-side JS, or <strong>Webpack</strong> if you're Mister-Fancy-Pants. In fact, the trend across the board is that compiling your site with modules via Webpack is winning dramatically. For all we know, this could be the last Babel Gulp tutorial ever written.</p><p>Right now we're focusing on the ability to use ECMAScript features on the frontend; a common use-case for things like... well... theming the presentation layer for a blog. If we can pull it off with Gulp, you probably won't struggle much with future methods.</p><h2 id=\"babel-npm-packages\">Babel NPM Packages</h2><p>Alright, so Babel isn't just a single NPM package. It's a lot. Let's see what's there in a basic <code>package.json</code>:</p><pre><code>{\n  \"name\": \"example\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"babel src -d lib\"\n  },\n  \"presets\": [\n    \"env\"\n  ],\n  \"engines\": {\n    \"node\": \"8.12.0\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@babel/polyfill\": \"^7.0.0\",\n    \"@babel/runtime\": \"^7.1.2\",\n    \"@babel/runtime-corejs2\": \"^7.1.2\",\n    \"babel-runtime\": \"^6.26.0\",\n    \"gulp-resolve-dependencies\": \"^2.2.0\",\n    \"gulp-sourcemaps\": \"^2.6.4\",\n    \"gulp-uglify-es\": \"^1.0.4\",\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@babel/cli\": \"^7.1.2\",\n    \"@babel/core\": \"^7.1.2\",\n    \"@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import\": \"^7.0.0\",\n    \"@babel/plugin-transform-runtime\": \"^7.1.0\",\n    \"@babel/preset-env\": \"^7.1.0\",\n  }\n}</code></pre><p>Let's not go through all these in detail- in fact, let's take a look at our <strong>gulpfile.js</strong>:</p><pre><code>'use strict';\n\nvar gulp = require('gulp'),\n  concat = require('gulp-concat'),\n  autoprefixer = require('gulp-autoprefixer'),\n  sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps'),\n  babel = require('gulp-babel'),\n  resolveDependencies = require('gulp-resolve-dependencies'),\n\n\nvar paths = {\n  scripts: {\n    src: 'src/js/*.js',\n    dest: 'assets/js'\n  }\n};\n\nfunction scripts() {\n  return gulp.src(paths.scripts.src)\n    .pipe(babel({\n          presets: ['@babel/env'],\n          plugins: ['@babel/transform-runtime', '@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import']\n    }))\n    .on('error', console.error.bind(console))\n    .pipe(resolveDependencies({\n            pattern: /\\* @requires [\\s-]*(.*\\.js)/g\n        }))\n    .pipe(concat('main.min.js'))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.scripts.dest));\n}</code></pre><p>Note that I've gone ahead and removed anything from the file that has nothing to do with Babel - everything seen here is strictly relevant to building a 'scripts' task. The gist is this:</p><p><strong>babel</strong> accepts two arrays:</p><ul><li><em>Presets</em> refers to the version of ECMAScript we're targeting, and what we have implies the latest.</li><li><em>Plugins</em> allow us to pass any plugins Babel supports; in this case, we're rendering stuff at runtime. Let's not get into it too far.</li></ul><p>The rest of the function is simple: we catch errors if any arise, we resolve required dependencies, and then we finally bunch everything into a single file and shove it in our destination folder.</p><h2 id=\"just-to-be-clear\">Just to be Clear</h2><p>When it comes to the <em>best</em> way of achieving ECMAScript 2015 or 2016 etc in the browser,  I'm no expert. As previously mentioned, the understanding I've passed on to you is a sort of bare minimum to start doing great things. </p><p>As far as what others are doing, I'd be willing to bet that the vast majority of devs utilizing newer ECMAScript functions are running frameworks like React, while the rest have reached a consensus that Webpack is king and Gulp lame. These things may be true.</p><p>No matter, this new found power of ours opens a lot of doors. Just wait until you see what we do with <strong>MongoDB Stitch</strong>.</p><p></p><p></p>","url":"https://hackersandslackers.com/babel-ecma-script/","uuid":"04fe6342-9462-4d3c-9e6d-bc000e17824a","page":false,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"comment_id":"5bb583642361b479aa119366"}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c12d7bfe875ad7bb8673718","title":"Reading and Writing to CSVs in Python","slug":"reading-and-writing-to-csvs-in-python","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://hackersandslackers.com/content/images/2018/09/csvpython2@2x.jpg","excerpt":"Playing with tabular data the native Python way.","custom_excerpt":"Playing with tabular data the native Python way.","created_at_pretty":"27 September, 2018","published_at_pretty":"27 September, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"05 November, 2018","created_at":"2018-09-27T13:22:47.000-04:00","published_at":"2018-09-27T18:35:00.000-04:00","updated_at":"2018-11-05T07:55:10.000-05:00","meta_title":"Reading and Writing to CSVs in Python | Hackers and Slackers","meta_description":"Using native Python libraries to interact with tabular data.

It seems as though the niche\nmarket of \"those who can't do, teach\" remains untapped for Flask, as the usual\nsuspects have yet to \"do\". This leaves newcomers like myself to hack away for\ntheir own survival in the meantime. I've only just turned that mental corner\nwhere Flask's quirks are as comforting as home-cooked meal, as opposed to\nfrustrating single-word methods containing 6 words of documentation on average.\n\nThe good news is I am still technically alive, after spending weeks building\nFlask applications mostly through trial and error. The bad news is that I've\nbecome Mr. Robot  in the process. That said, if there will ever be an ideal\nmoment in my life to write about Flask, now is the time. As reality slowly slips\naway in 1s and 0s, I may as well pass along  what I've learned.\n\nBroad Strokes\nIt only takes a couple minutes into explaining what Flask is when you realize\nthat Flask, at its core, is overwhelmingly just the “V” in “MVC”. Jinja handles\nthe templates, and something like SQLAlchemy will likely handle your models.\nFlask has an abundance of third-party libraries to handle business logic, but it\nis the core Flask package that we all agreed to gather around. This speaks\nvolumes about the quality of Flask’s simple yet powerful request handling.\n\nI'll  break down as many of Flask's out-of-the-box features, focusing on what\nmatters most (in my opinion). Take a look at some of the Flask libraries we'll\nbe playing around with:\n\n# app.py\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, Session, g\nimport os\n\nConfiguring Our App\nAs always, we create our app with app = Flask(name). Equally uninteresting is\nour configuration setup, which we'll import via a class in config.py:\n\n# app.py\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, Session, g\nimport config\nimport os\n\n# Our app\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n# Load our config variables\napp.config.from_object('config.ProductionConfig')\n\nA number of things in our config are absolutely essential for sessions to work.\nBelow is an example config file:\n\n# config.py\nimport os\n\nclass ProductionConfig():\n    \"\"\"Set app config vars.\"\"\"\n    SECRET_KEY = os.urandom(24)\n    SESSION_TYPE = null\n    SESSION_COOKIE_NAME = 'session name'\n    SESSION_PERMANENT = True\n    PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME = timedelta(days=31) (2678400 seconds)\n\nSECRET_KEY  is critical: this variable needs to exist in out config for sessions\nto function properly. The best way to handle is is by generating a key as seen\nabove.\n\nSESSION_TYPE  allows us to specify where our session data should be stored. This\nis set null by default, but Flask supports a number of options:\n\n * RedisSessionInterface:  Uses the Redis key-value store as a session backend. \n * MemcachedSessionInterface:  Uses the Memcached as a session backend. \n * FileSystemSessionInterface:  werkzeug.contrib.cache.FileSystemCache  as a\n   session backend.\n * MongoDBSessionInterface:  Uses MongoDB as a backend \n   [http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/index.html]via pymongo\n * SqlAlchemySessionInterface:  Uses SQLAlchemy, or rather Flask-SQLAlchemy\n   [https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/]\n\nThere are plenty more variables you can set if you want to take a look here\n[http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/config/].\n\nSessions and Contexts\nUnlike cookie-based sessions, Flask sessions are handled and stored on the\nserver-side. A session object is simply a dict which is accessible throughout\nthe application a global level, referring to a single 'logged-in user'. As long\nas the session is active, any context of our app will be able to retrieve,\nmodify, or delete the values held in this session object,\n\n# Save a value to the user's session.\nsession['username'] = 'MyUsername' \n\n# IMPORTANT: \"True\" forces our changes to be recognized.\nsession.modified = True: \n\n# Retrieve session values at any time, anywhere \nsession.get('username') = True\n\nSeeing as how sessions are accessible globally, it is also important to note\nthat sessions can last a very long time; pretty much self explanatory given the \nSESSION_PERMANENT = True  configuration option.  It's a good idea to set a\nsession timeout period, or better yet, close them by the user's own request.\nClearing a session is as simple as resetting the session dictionary values back\nto None  by using the pop  method: session.pop('value', None).\n\nThe Application Context\nBesides undying global sessions,  Flask also provides us with a feature with an\nobject more suitable for storing and passing temporary values between app\ncontexts. This object known simply as g. While  technically an abbreviation for\n\"global\",g  is really just a convenient place to store temporarily store values\nwhich you can always depend on to be by your side.\n\n# app.py\nfrom Flask import g\n\nIt's important to note that values assigned to g  only exist within the context\nthey were created by default. For example, if we store information to the object\ndue to some user interaction on the dashboard, these values are lost once the\nuser moves to another part of our app. That said, values assigned to g  can\ntechnically be passed between contexts if we return g.value. This distinction\nbetween always-alive sessions  and every dying g  should be indicative of what\nreach respective object does.  Spoiler alert: sensitive (or contextually\nuseless) data should be stored temporarily with g, where values which will\ncontinuously be useful in determining the functionality of our should should\nreside in session.\n\nInterestingly enough, Flask has a decorator  specifically for terminating values\nsaved to g  in the case we'd want to ensure the swift and total annihilation of\nsuch data. For instance, if we were to assign a database connection to g  using\ng.db = connect_to_database(), we'd want to make sure that connection is closed\nas fast as possible before we forget:\n\n# app.py\ndef db_stuff():\n    g.db = database_connection()\n    g.db.somequeryorwhatever\n    return g.db\n\n@app.teardown_appcontext\ndef teardown_db():\n    db = g.pop('db', None)\n\nRoutes & Decorators\nWe're surely familiar with the concepts behind routing users to deserved views\nby now. Before we look at the juicy stuff, consider this boring route for a\nboring product, where the homepage is a dashboard:\n\n# app.py\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST', 'OPTIONS'])\ndef dashboard():\n    \"\"\"Boring route.\"\"\"\n    return render_template('/dashboard.html')\n\nOh snap, our landing page is a /dashboard?  How will we know which user's\ndashboard to display when they visit the dashboard, or any other page for that\nmatter? If only there were a way to intercept every request a user makes to our\napp?\n\nFlask comes with a bunch of insanely useful decorators. Python decorators are\nfunctions which either 'wrap'  other functions in additional logic, or in our\ncase, intercept functions to do with them what we what. Flask has a vast\nplethora of logic decorators, ranging from detecting first-time visitors,\nhandling exceptions, executing logic before/after page loads, etc. Even the\nroute we set above is a decorator!\n\n@flask.before_request\nAdding before_request  to our app allows us to run logic prior to the\naforementioned request. With this power, we can do things like treat users\ndifferently (such as recognized or anonymous users), or just execute some sort\nof unique logic upon page load. \n\nIn this simple case, we check to see if a visitor has an active session every\ntime they hit a route. This way, if a user's session expired between before\nhitting a route in our app, we can prompt them to log in... or whatever. \n\nbefore_request doesn't accept any value parameters - the handler is mostly\nintended to perform tasks such as making a database query necessary for our app\nto run, or make sure users are still logged in.\n\n# app.py\n@app.before_request\ndef before_request():\n    \"\"\"Handle multiple users.\"\"\"\n    if 'username' in session:\n        return render_template('/dashboard.html')\n    else:\n        return render_template('/login.html')\n\n@flask.url_value_preprocessor\nUnlike before_request, url_value_preprocessor  does  accept incoming data. This\nallows us to handle data being posted to any part of our app before we even\nbother serving up views. Not only does this provide a convenient separation of\nconcerns, but also helps us avoid callback hell, which yes, can happen in Python\ntoo.\n\nLet's say we're accepting a POST request, where we create a view for our user's\npersonal details. When the user passes us their email address, we decide to\nretrieve the user's records by hitting an API, and passing the results to the\nview.\n\nWithout modularizing our code, we'd have to handle things like waiting on API\ncalls in the same functions as  our routes. Not only is this shitty repetitive\ncode, but running numerous API calls and rendering a view all at once is going\nto eventually break. Go ahead and ask the NodeJS guys. They'll know.\n\n# app.py\n@app.url_value_preprocessor\ndef url_value_preprocessor(endpoint, values):\n    \"\"\"Handle data sent to any route.\"\"\"\n       if request.args:\n           email = request.args.get('email')\n           r = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, data=email)\n           session['usermetadata'] = r\n           session.modified = True\n           return session\n\nYou're Only Getting Started\nWe've only covered small percentage of convenient tools Flask offers us. Go\nahead and see how many decorators [http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/api/]   you\ncan fuck with. Yeah dude, shit is legit - and we haven't even talked about the\nFlask-Login package yet.\n\nThe beauty of lightweight frameworks is that they focus on the problems that\ndrive us to web frameworks in the first place. Flask is clearly designed to\nhandle serving views, standing up APIs, and handling user management\neffectively. Contrast this with frameworks like Django, which forces rigid app\nsetup in what can commonly be an  hour-long setup or greater. I'll truthfully\nalways have a place in my heart for Django as the fathers of Python MVC: I would\ncan say with confidence that without the creation of Django (as well as the\nofficial $10 dollar intro book from Barnes and Noble) I never would have\ntransitioned from an obnoxious product manager  personality to the kind of guy\nwho owns multiple Python t-shirts. Hmm. Now that I think about it, maybe I\nshould've stayed an office tool as opposed to solving all these complex\nproblems. oh well.\n\nFlask is indicative of a new direction of framework design - or rather lack\nthereof. Programmers who know what they're doing  can express themselves outside\nof traditional boundaries set by other frameworks, surely designed to keep\nidiots from ruining everything. There's nothing wrong with being a worker drone\nrepeating the same worthless projects,  using same libraries, and essentially\ncontributing nothing to humanity. I'd personally prefer to take the freedom and\nspeed of Flask any day.","html":"<p>It isn't often you find somebody sad or miserable enough to detail the inner workings of web framework features, such as sessions or routing.

It was the greatest\ncredential any programmer could possibly strive for: yes ladies and gentlemen,\nnone other than yours truly became an officially recognized licensed\nprofessional: I had just completed the last Python course in Codecademy.\n\nCongrats! You know nothing.Armed with this new unfathomable knowledge, I was\nready to take on the world. I did have a few gaps in my knowledge, such as:\n\n * Experience with Linux\n * General idea of what a terminal is and why anybody would use one\n * Basic understanding of the internet\n * Motor skills needed to survive\n\nThat aside, I was determined. Nothing could stop me, which turns out to be a\nreally bad attitude when you're SSHed into a VPS with root access, and zero\nhesitation to wreak havoc upon any and all system files. You see where this is\ngoing.\n\nDear Stack Overflow: I Think I Deleted Python\nDisabling your system's native Python version, whether via deletion or a\nmisconfigured PATH, is a coming-of-age cliché as timeless as losing one's\nvirginity on prom night. Young developers flock to Stack Overflow pleading for\nhelp, while those senior enough to reply sigh a gasp of nostalgia before\nreassuring them that their efforts are pointless. \"Ah yes,\" they reminisce, \"I\nremember my first devastating life-altering failure. To be young again.\"\n\nIf you're lucky enough to be unaware, UNIX based systems depend on their\nnatively installed version of Python to run, well, almost everything. If Python\nis unavailable for just a moment, the developer loses the ability to use:\n\n * vi\n * vim\n * nano\n * grep\n * source\n * wait, SOURCE?\n\nYep, the command you'd normally use to relaunch a corrupted startup file (such\nas the one that holds your PATH  variable) is totally unusable. Not that it\nmatters, what are you going to do, edit it?  Oh right, you just ruined every\nbash text editor. I'd actually be more interested in seeing what DOES work\nwithout Python configuring on Mac/Linux, other than moving up and down your file\nstructure helplessly, trying to quantify the damage you just wrecked upon your\nwork, life, and career.\n\nSo, Should I Kill Myself?\nHow to destroy everything ever.Calm yourself and stick with me here; I have no\ninterest in writing long-winded posts without providing any sort of solution.\nThat said, I have no problem making you sit down and think about what you've\ndone while I bother getting to the point. Nobody else has fixed this for you\nyet, and I need to improve my site's metrics, so it seems like we need each\nother on this one.\n\nBesides, don't be so hard on yourself. Not even a week ago, I sat with a Senior\nDeveloper to review my development stack, and how that would fit into the\ncurrent ecosystem of the department. Naturally I explained that I prefer running\n Flask  on Python 3.7, as I adjusted my motorcycle jacket and sat forward to\ncasually   extinguish a cigarette on his desk. Even through my vision was\nobstructed by the timelessly classic aviators resting on my face, I could see\nthe letters roll across the terminal window before him as he typed. The poor\nbastard running a 4-year old Linux distribution had just checked if Python 3 was\ninstalled on his live production instance, when his fingertips unleashed the\nunmistakable export PATH=..., seconds away from linking CentOS' native Python\nfrom Python 2.7 to Python 3.7. My exact reaction was something along the lines\nof \"OH GOD NO DON'T DO THAT STOP HOLY MOTHER OF JESUS FUCK!\" \n\nHe stopped typing. The day was saved, and I was able to explain the importance\nof leaving native Python versions intact on the systems they come installed on.\nThen, I myself fucked up the Python path maybe an hour later. On production.\n\nWe all do dumb things sometimes. That doesn't mean you're dumb. Well, except in\nmy case, having done this countless times before. Some of us simply like to live\ndangerously. Fortune favors the bold, and so on.\n\nRetro meme outta nowhere!Getting out of this Mess\nNow that we've hit rock bottom, where do we go from here? Well, two things to\nkeep in mind:\n\n 1. Not everything  is broken without Python. Extreme foreshadowing.\n 2. Restarting a terminal will automatically run all startup scripts.\n\nBy now you know that .bash_profile  and .bashrc  are critically important to\nyour system, considering how badly you've fucked things up just now. These files\nset important variables for your system every time you open your terminal; more\nspecifically, .bash_profile  kicks in on any sort of user log in (such as SSH)\nwhere .bashrc  fires every time a new additional terminal window is opened. Even\nif your startup files are corrupted, the system will always love them and turn\nto them regardless of how horribly disfigured you left them. Talk about a spark\nof hope.\n\nOn Mac OSX\nI'll admit I'm a bit embarrassed at how long it took me to realize this: even\nthough you ruined every text editor known to man, there's one resilient enough\nto hold strong. The name? TextEdit.\n\nReveal hidden files in OSX easily.In your root directory, a combo ofShift + Cmd + .  displays all hidden files.\nCheck out bash_profile. Fix it, save it, reopen terminal. Cancel the suicide\nparty. Pop the Champagne.\n\nOn Linux\nNo GUI can save us now, but what can? Perhaps a command so stupid, so simple,\nthat it couldn't possibly need Python to work:\n\necho 'export PATH=\"/YOUR/ORIGINAL/PATH/2.7/bin:${PATH}\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\n\n\nThis appends the text you provide to the end of an existing file. .bash_profile \nand .bashrc  both only pay attention to the last exported PATH in the document,\nwhich means the rest of your file will work, and the only PATH which is\nrespected is the one which you've presumably entered correctly this time around.\nRestart your terminal. Get back in the game son: it ain't about how hard you\nhit, but how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.\n\nSidenote\nWe're not exactly conducting rocket science here (data science is a close second\nperhaps? Just kidding. We barely know what's going on most of the time). I felt\ncompelled to write this post for two reasons: one being how common and\ndestructive this pitfall can be for most people, but more importantly, the\nknee-jerk reaction veterans have in response to this problem is \"good luck,\nyou're fucked.\" \n\nI'm not here to comment on the integrity of our fine anonymous internet\ncommunities, but the discrepancy between how devastating losing a server can be\ndoesn't seem to met with much urgency by anybody with insight. Nobody taught me\nhow to work around these issues. Had I listened to anonymous internet advice, I\nprobably wouldn't let entire servers of sensitive data for dead, including my\npersonal machines. I worked through it, and quite frankly, I'm kind of a fucking\nidiot [https://hackersandslackers.com/about/], as is our mission statement.
