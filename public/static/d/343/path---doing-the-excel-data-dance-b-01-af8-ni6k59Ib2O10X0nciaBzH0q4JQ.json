However, I've neglected to discuss\nwhat types of things you'll actually encounter out in the wild that requires\nsome fancy Excel footwork. Well, that's what this post is all about.\n\nThe first question: what is Excel actually for. Truth be told, if you separate\nthe VB elements and the pivot tables from Excel, it was really just a way for\naccountants to make small changes to tax forms and have them reflected later in\nthe form (something that had to be done by hand prior to the invention of\nExcel's progenitor...which had to have been horrible). With that in mind, one\nneeds to understand that everything else that Excel can do is built on top  of\nthis relatively rudimentary foundation, and interestingly enough, the vast\nmajority of software functions in the same way: for example, the reason why the\nlast dozen or so Bethesda games all have similar glitches and gameplay is\nbecause they're all built on a nearly decade old engine, and anyone who works at\na company that managed a database for a lengthy period of time knows that it's\nmuch easier to build on top of the garbage than to clean anything up (that's\nalso why there's all that cut content that still exists in games when you used a\ngame genie as a kid...it's too difficult to take that stuff out without harming\nthe juicy center!).\n\nThe pros of this model is that because Excel was made to handle accounting work,\nit handles relatively small datasets (and \"small\" here is under a million\nrows...I've managed to push excel to about 250k rows without it exploding...but\nnot much more than that) very quickly, and in a very user friendly and visual\nformat. In other words, Your boss uses Excel because it's pretty easy to\nunderstand what's going on (and you can see  the data). As such, you can think\nof Excel as the \"Lingua Franca\" (the language that two dignitaries of separate\nnations speak to conduct diplomacy...or perhaps, the Basic to your Star Wars\nUniverse) of the data world. To put this as simply as possible, unless you're\nworking for a company where EVERYONE has a background in computer/data science,\nyou're going to need to figure out a way to get your data into an Excel friendly\nformat somehow. The reason for this may have to do with self selection, people\nwho like getting into code go into heavy data, people like me who like to fix\nproblems tend to be intermediaries, and the people who actually make money for\nour companies (or at least are able to convince others that money is made)...are\nbusiness people.\n\nNow brace yourself, because this sounds completely insane: the daily workflow of\na Business Analyst (or a BA) at many companies is taking data that already\nexists in one form on one platform (generally either tableau, a business\nintelligence program, or some sort of database), exporting it to an Excel\nfriendly format, manipulating the data so it makes sense, drawing some sort of\nsalient conclusion from it (usually using a lookup, a pivot, or both),\npresenting it to management, and then putting it back into a format that the\nheavy data people can use to start this engine all over again.\n\nThe funny part is, the actual mechanics of doing this work isn't hard, if\neveryone is on the same page, you could probably take care of this whole\nworkflow in maybe half a day. Alas, blogs like this wouldn't need to be written\nif mechanics always worked the way they should, and another golden rule is that\nmultiple departments are never  on the same page. In other words, the data you\nget is going to be \"dirty\" and next time, I'm going to show you some common\ndirty data dilemmas, and how to polish it up with nothing but a few = signs, a\ncouple of commands, a pivot table or two, and a shitload of ingenuity.\n\nBut as always, a summary. In this post, we learned:\n\n * What Excel is good at\n * What Excel perhaps isn't so good at\n * Why you still need to deal with Excel\n * The day to day of someone who deals in both the data space and the management\n   space...and\n * That troubleshooting this step is what ultimately earns you your paycheck.\n\nFinally, a quick aside to placate my fellow authors and friends on this fine\nblog, your data being dirty on my end doesn't mean you did anything wrong, it's\nthat bouncing from one platform to another and back was never meant to be easy.","html":"<p>If you've been reading along, over the last several posts you've learned the two major skills that any self-respecting Excel jockey counts as their go-tos: the ability to <em>lookup</em> (remember, I'm partial to index-match, but if you learned VH lookup, ride that until you crash your system) and the ability to <em>pivot</em>.</p><p>Now here's something really interesting: until we pierce the veil on doing some VB macros, by truly mastering just those two skills, you can handle basically any job that Excel can actually handle, anything more advanced is just a matter of doing it faster (and faster, and faster).
