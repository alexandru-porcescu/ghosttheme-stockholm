We fully\nunderstand how to structure a sensible application; we can serve up complex\npage\ntemplates\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/powerful-page-templates-in-flask-with-jinja/],\nand have dived into interacting with databases using Flask-SQLAlchemy\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/manage-database-models-with-flask-sqlalchemy/].\nFor our next challenge, we’re going to need all  of the knowledge we've acquired\nthus far and much, much more. Welcome to the Super Bowl of Flask development.\nThis. Is. Flask-Login.\n\nFlask-Login [https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/]  is a dope library\nwhich handles all aspects of user management, including vital nuances you might\nnot expect. Some noteworthy features include securing parts of our app behind\nlogin walls, encrypting passwords, and handling sessions. Moreover, It plays\nnicely with other Flask libraries we’re already familiar with: Flask-SQLAlchemy\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/manage-database-models-with-flask-sqlalchemy/] \nto create and fetch accounts, and Flask-WTForms\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/guide-to-building-forms-in-flask/]  for handling\nintelligent sign-up & log-in forms. This tutorial assumes you have some working\nknowledge of these things.\n\nFlask-Login is shockingly quite easy to use after the initial learning curve...\nbut therein lies the catch. Perhaps I’m not the only one to have noticed, but\nmost Flask-related documentation tends to be, well, God-awful. The community is\nriddled with helplessly outdated information; if you ever come across flask.ext \nin a tutorial, it is inherently worthless to anybody developing in 2019. To make\nmatters worse, official Flask-Login documentation contains some artifacts which\nare just plain wrong. The documentation contradicts itself (I’ll show you what I\nmean), and offers little to no code examples to speak of. My only hope is that I\nmight save somebody the endless headaches I’ve experienced myself.\n\nStructuring Our Application\nLet’s start with installing dependencies. This should give you an idea of what\nyou’re in for:\n\n$ pip3 install flask flask-login flask-sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary python-dotenv\n\n\nSweet. Let’s take this one step at a time, starting with our project file\nstructure:\n\nflasklogin-tutorial\n├── /login_tutorial\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── auth.py\n│   ├── forms.py\n│   ├── models.py\n│   ├── routes.py\n│   ├── /static\n│   │   ├── /dist\n│   │   │   ├── /css\n│   │   │   │   ├── account.css\n│   │   │   │   └── dashboard.css\n│   │   │   └── /js\n│   │   │       └── main.min.js\n│   │   └── /src\n│   │       ├── /js\n│   │       │   └── main.js\n│   │       └── /less\n│   │           ├── account.less\n│   │           ├── dashboard.less\n│   │           └── vars.less\n│   └── /templates\n│       ├── dashboard.html\n│       ├── layout.html\n│       ├── login.html\n│       ├── meta.html\n│       ├── scripts.html\n│       └── signup.html\n├── config.py\n├── requirements.txt\n├── setup.py\n├── start.sh\n└── wsgi.py\n\n\nOf course, I wouldn't be a gentleman unless I revealed my config.py  as well:\n\nimport os\n\n\nclass Config:\n    \"\"\"Set Flask configuration vars from .env file.\"\"\"\n\n    # General Config\n    SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')\n    FLASK_APP = os.environ.get('FLASK_APP')\n    FLASK_ENV = os.environ.get('FLASK_ENV')\n    FLASK_DEBUG = os.environ.get('FLASK_DEBUG')\n\n    # Database\n    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get('SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI')\n    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = os.environ.get('SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS')\n\n\nThe configuration values live in a .env  file, a practice I highly encourage. Of\nthese configuration variables, SECRET_KEY  is where we should turn our\nattention. SECRET_KEY is the equivalent of a password used to secure our app; it\nshould be as long, nonsensical, and impossible-to-remember as humanly possible.\nSeriously: having your secret key compromised is the equivalent of feeding\ngremlins after midnight.\n\nInitializing Flask-Login\nWith a standard \"application factory\" app, setting up Flask-Login is no\ndifferent from other Flask plugins (or whatever they're called now). This makes\nsetting up easy; all we need to do is make sure Flask-Login  is initialized in \n__init__.py  along with the rest of our plugins:\n\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\nfrom flask_login import LoginManager\n\n\ndb = SQLAlchemy()\nlogin_manager = LoginManager()\n\n\ndef create_app():\n    \"\"\"Construct the core application.\"\"\"\n    app = Flask(__name__, instance_relative_config=False)\n\n    # Application Configuration\n    app.config.from_object('config.Config')\n\n    # Initialize Plugins\n    db.init_app(app)\n    login_manager.init_app(app)\n\n    with app.app_context():\n        # Import parts of our application\n        from . import routes\n        from . import login\n        app.register_blueprint(routes.main_bp)\n        app.register_blueprint(login.login_bp)\n\n        # Initialize Global db\n        db.create_all()\n\n        return app\n\n\nIn the above example, we're using the minimal number of plug-ins to get logins\nworking: Flask-SQLAlchemy  and Flask-Login.\n\nTo keep our sanity, we're going to separate our login routes from our main\napplication routes and logic. This is why we register a Blueprint called auth_bp\n, imported from a file called auth.py. Our “main” application (AKA anything that\nisn’t logging in) will instead live in routes.py, in a Blueprint called main_bp.\nWe'll come back to these in a moment\n\nCreating a User Model\nWe'll save our User  model in models.py. There are a few things to keep in mind\nwhen creating models compatible with Flask-Login- the most important being the\nutilization of UserMixin  from the flask_login  library. When we inherit our\nclass from UserMixin,  our model is immediately extended to include all the\nmethods necessary for Flask-Login to work. This is by far the easiest way of\ncreating a User model. I won't bother getting into details of what these methods\ndo, because if you simply begin your class with class User(UserMixin, db.Model):\n, you genuinely don't need to understand any of it:\n\nfrom . import db\nfrom flask_login import UserMixin\nfrom werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash\n\n\nclass User(UserMixin, db.Model):\n    \"\"\"Model for user accounts.\"\"\"\n\n    __tablename__ = 'flasklogin-users'\n\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer,\n                   primary_key=True,\n                   )\n    name = db.Column(db.String,\n                     nullable=False,\n                     unique=False)\n    email = db.Column(db.String(40),\n                      unique=True,\n                      nullable=False\n                      )\n    password = db.Column(db.String(200),\n                         primary_key=False,\n                         unique=False,\n                         nullable=False\n                         )\n    website = db.Column(db.String(60),\n                        index=False,\n                        unique=False,\n                        nullable=True\n                        )\n    created_on = db.Column(db.DateTime,\n                           index=False,\n                           unique=False,\n                           nullable=True\n                           )\n    last_login = db.Column(db.DateTime,\n                           index=False,\n                           unique=False,\n                           nullable=True\n                           )\n\n    def set_password(self, password):\n        \"\"\"Create hashed password.\"\"\"\n        self.password = generate_password_hash(password, method='sha256')\n\n    def check_password(self, password):\n        \"\"\"Check hashed password.\"\"\"\n        return check_password_hash(self.password, password)\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return '<User {}>'.format(self.username)\n\n\nThe set_password  and check_password  methods don't necessarily need to live\ninside our User model, but it's nice to keep related logic bundled together and\nout of our routes.\n\nYou may notice that our password field explicitly allows 200 characters: this is\nbecause our database will be storing hashed passwords. Thus, even if a user's\npassword is 8 characters long, the string in our database will look much\ndifferent.\n\nCreating Log-in and Sign-up Forms\nIf you're well versed in WTForms, our form logic in forms.py  probably looks as\nyou'd expect. Of course, the constraints we set here are to handle front-end\nvalidation only:\n\nfrom wtforms import Form, StringField, PasswordField, validators, SubmitField\nfrom wtforms.validators import ValidationError, DataRequired, Email, EqualTo, Length, Optional\n\n\nclass SignupForm(Form):\n    \"\"\"User Signup Form.\"\"\"\n\n    name = StringField('Name',\n                        validators=[DataRequired(message=('Enter a fake name or something.'))])\n    email = StringField('Email',\n                        validators=[Length(min=6, message=('Please enter a valid email address.')),\n                                    Email(message=('Please enter a valid email address.')),\n                                    DataRequired(message=('Please enter a valid email address.'))])\n    password = PasswordField('Password',\n                             validators=[DataRequired(message='Please enter a password.'),\n                                         Length(min=6, message=('Please select a stronger password.')),\n                                         EqualTo('confirm', message='Passwords must match')])\n    confirm = PasswordField('Confirm Your Password',)\n    website = StringField('Website',\n                          validators=[Optional()])\n    submit = SubmitField('Register')\n\n\nclass LoginForm(Form):\n    \"\"\"User Login Form.\"\"\"\n\n    email = StringField('Email', validators=[DataRequired('Please enter a valid email address.'),\n                                             Email('Please enter a valid email address.')])\n    password = PasswordField('Password', validators=[DataRequired('Uhh, your password tho?')])\n    submit = SubmitField('Log In')\n\n\nWith those out of the way, let's look at how we implement these on the Jinja\nside.\n\nsignup.html\n{% extends \"layout.html\" %}\n\n{% block pagestyles %}\n    <link href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='dist/css/account.css') }}\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n{% endblock %}\n\n{% block content %}\n  <div class=\"formwrapper\">\n    <form method=post>\n      <div class=\"logo\">\n        <img src=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='dist/img/logo.png') }}\">\n      </div>\n      {% for message in get_flashed_messages() %}\n        <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"alert\">&times;</button>\n            {{ message }}\n        </div>\n      {% endfor %}\n      <h1>Sign Up</h1>\n      <div class=\"name\">\n        {{ form.name.label }}\n        {{ form.name(placeholder='John Smith') }}\n        {% if form.name.errors %}\n          <ul class=\"errors\">\n            {% for error in form.email.errors %}<li>{{ error }}</li>{% endfor %}\n          </ul>\n        {% endif %}\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"email\">\n        {{ form.email.label }}\n        {{ form.email(placeholder='youremail@example.com') }}\n        {% if form.email.errors %}\n          <ul class=\"errors\">\n            {% for error in form.email.errors %}<li>{{ error }}</li>{% endfor %}\n          </ul>\n        {% endif %}\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"password\">\n        {{ form.password.label }}\n        {{ form.password }}\n        {% if form.password.errors %}\n          <ul class=\"errors\">\n            {% for error in form.password.errors %}<li>{{ error }}</li>{% endfor %}\n          </ul>\n        {% endif %}\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"confirm\">\n        {{ form.confirm.label }}\n        {{ form.confirm }}\n        {% if form.confirm.errors %}\n          <ul class=\"errors\">\n            {% for error in form.confirm.errors %}<li>{{ error }}</li>{% endfor %}\n          </ul>\n        {% endif %}\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"website\">\n        {{ form.website.label }}\n        {{ form.website(placeholder='http://example.com') }}\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"submitbutton\">\n        <input id=\"submit\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n      </div>\n    </form>\n    <div class=\"loginsignup\">\n      <span>Already have an account?

Without the\nauthentication logic added quite yet, these routes look almost identical thus\nfar.\n\nEach time a user visits a page in your app, the corresponding route is sent a \nrequest  object. This object contains contextual information about the request\nmade by the user, such as the type of request (GET or POST), any form data which\nwas submitted, etc. We leverage this to see whether the user is just arriving at\nthe page for the first time (a GET request), or if they're attempting to sign in\n(a POST request). The fairly clever takeaway here is that our login pages verify\nusers by making POST requests to themselves: this allows us to keep all logic\nrelated to logging in or signing up in a single route.\n\nSigning Up\nWe're able to validate the submitted form by importing the SignupForm  class and\npassing request.form  as the form in question. if signup_form.validate()  checks\nthe information submitted by the user against all the form's validators. If any\nof the validators are not met, the user is redirected back to the signup form\nwith error messages present.\n\nAssuming that our user isn't inept, we can move on with our logic. First, we\nneed to make sure a user with the provided email doesn't already exist:\n\n...\n\n@auth_bp.route('/signup', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef signup_page():\n    \"\"\"User sign-up page.\"\"\"\n    signup_form = SignupForm(request.form)\n    # POST: Sign user in\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        if signup_form.validate():\n            # Get Form Fields\n            name = request.form.get('name')\n            email = request.form.get('email')\n            password = request.form.get('password')\n            website = request.form.get('website')\n            existing_user = User.query.filter_by(email=email).first()\n            if existing_user is None:\n                user = User(name=name,\n                            email=email,\n                            password=generate_password_hash(password, method='sha256'),\n                            website=website)\n                db.session.add(user)\n                db.session.commit()\n                login_user(user)\n                return redirect(url_for('main_bp.dashboard'))\n            flash('A user already exists with that email address.')\n            return redirect(url_for('auth_bp.signup_page'))\n    # GET: Serve Sign-up page\n    return render_template('/signup.html',\n                           title='Create an Account | Flask-Login Tutorial.',\n                           form=SignupForm(),\n                           template='signup-page',\n                           body=\"Sign up for a user account.\")\n\n\nIf existing_user is None, we're all clear to actually clear to create a new user\nrecord. We create an instance of our User model via user = User(...). We then\nadd the user via standard SQLAlchemy syntax and finally use the imported method \nlogin_user()  to log the user in.\n\nIf everything goes well, the user will finally be redirected to the main\napplication, which is handled by return redirect(url_for('main_bp.dashboard')):\n\nA successful user log in.And here's what will happen if we log out and try to\nsign up with the same information:\n\nAttempting to sign up with an existing emailLogging In\nMoving on to our login route:\n\n@auth_bp.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef login_page():\n    \"\"\"User login page.\"\"\"\n    # Bypass Login screen if user is logged in\n    if current_user.is_authenticated:\n        return redirect(url_for('main_bp.dashboard'))\n    login_form = LoginForm(request.form)\n    # POST: Create user and redirect them to the app\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        if login_form.validate():\n            # Get Form Fields\n            email = request.form.get('email')\n            password = request.form.get('password')\n            # Validate Login Attempt\n            user = User.query.filter_by(email=email).first()\n            if user:\n                if user.check_password(password=password):\n                    login_user(user)\n                    next = request.args.get('next')\n                    return redirect(next or url_for('main_bp.dashboard'))\n        flash('Invalid username/password combination')\n        return redirect(url_for('auth_bp.login_page'))\n    # GET: Serve Log-in page\n    return render_template('login.html',\n                           form=LoginForm(),\n                           title='Log in | Flask-Login Tutorial.',\n                           template='login-page',\n                           body=\"Log in with your User account.\")\n\n\nThis should mostly look the same! our logic is identical up until the point\nwhere we check to see if the user exists. This time, a match results in success\nas opposed to a failure. Continuing, we then use user.check_password()  to check\nthe hashed password we created earlier with user.generate_password_hash(). Both\nof these methods handle the encrypting and decrypting of passwords on their own\n(based on that SECRET_KEY we created earlier) to ensure that nobody (not even\nus) has any business looking at user passwords.\n\nAs with last time, a successful login ends in login_user(user). Our redirect\nlogic is little more sophisticated this time around: instead of always sending\nthe user back to the dashboard, we check for next, which is a parameter stored\nin the query string of the current user. If the user attempted to access our app\nbefore logging in, next  would equal the page they had attempted to reach: this\nallows us wall-off our app from unauthorized users, and then drop users off at\nthe page they attempted to reach before they logged in:\n\nA successful log inIMPORTANT: Login Helpers\nBefore your app can work like the above, we need to finish auth.py  by providing\na few more routes:\n\n@auth_bp.route(\"/logout\")\n@login_required\ndef logout_page():\n    \"\"\"User log-out logic.\"\"\"\n    logout_user()\n    return redirect(url_for('auth_bp.login_page'))\n\n\n@login_manager.user_loader\ndef load_user(user_id):\n    \"\"\"Check if user is logged-in on every page load.\"\"\"\n    if user_id is not None:\n        return User.query.get(user_id)\n    return None\n\n\n@login_manager.unauthorized_handler\ndef unauthorized():\n    \"\"\"Redirect unauthorized users to Login page.\"\"\"\n    flash('You must be logged in to view that page.')\n    return redirect(url_for('auth_bp.login_page'))\n\n\nOur first route, logout_page, handles the logic of users logging out. This will\nsimply end the user's session and redirect them to the login screen.\n\nload_user  is critical for making our app work: before every page load, our app\nmust verify whether or not the user is logged in (or still  logged in after time\nhas elapsed). user_loader  loads users by their unique ID. If a user is\nreturned, this signifies a logged-out user. Otherwise, when None  is returned,\nthe user is logged out.\n\nLastly, we have the unauthorized  route, which uses the unauthorized_handler \ndecorator for dealing with unauthorized users. Any time a user attempts to hit\nour app and is unauthorized, this route will fire.\n\nThe Last Piece: routes.py\nThe last thing we'll cover is how to protect parts of our app from unauthorized\nusers. Here's what we have in routes.py:\n\nimport os\nfrom flask import Blueprint, render_template\nfrom flask_assets import Environment, Bundle\nfrom flask_login import current_user\nfrom flask import current_app as app\nfrom .models import User\nfrom flask_login import login_required\n\n\n# Blueprint Configuration\nmain_bp = Blueprint('main_bp', __name__,\n                    template_folder='templates',\n                    static_folder='static')\nassets = Environment(app)\n\n\n@main_bp.route('/', methods=['GET'])\n@login_required\ndef dashboard():\n    \"\"\"Serve logged in Dashboard.\"\"\"\n    return render_template('dashboard.html',\n                           title='Flask-Login Tutorial.',\n                           template='dashboard-template',\n                           current_user=current_user,\n                           body=\"You are now logged in!\")\n\n\nThe magic here is all contained within the @login_required  decorator. When this\ndecorator is present on a route, the following things happen:\n\n * The @login_manager.user_loader  route we created determines whether or not\n   the user is authorized to view the page (logged in). If the user is logged\n   in, they'll be permitted to view the page.\n * If the user is not logged in, the user will be redirected as per the logic in\n   the route decorated with @login_manager.unauthorized_handler.\n * The name of the route the user attempted to access will be stored in the URL\n   as ?url=[name-of-route]. This what allows next  to work.\n\nThere You Have It\nIf you've made it this far, I commend you for your courage.

The community is riddled with helplessly outdated information; if you ever come across <code>flask.ext</code> in a tutorial, it is inherently worthless to anybody developing in 2019. To make matters worse, official Flask-Login documentation contains some artifacts which are just plain wrong. The documentation contradicts itself (I’ll show you what I mean), and offers little to no code examples to speak of. My only hope is that I might save somebody the endless headaches I’ve experienced myself.</p><h2 id=\"structuring-our-application\">Structuring Our Application</h2><p>Let’s start with installing dependencies.

Seriously: having your secret key compromised is the equivalent of feeding gremlins after midnight.</p><h2 id=\"initializing-flask-login\">Initializing Flask-Login</h2><p>With a standard \"application factory\" app, setting up Flask-Login is no different from other Flask plugins (or whatever they're called now). This makes setting up easy; all we need to do is make sure <strong>Flask-Login</strong> is initialized in <code>__init__.py</code> along with the rest of our plugins:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Flask\nfrom flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\nfrom flask_login import LoginManager\n\n\ndb = SQLAlchemy()\nlogin_manager = LoginManager()\n\n\ndef create_app():\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;Construct the core application.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n    app = Flask(__name__, instance_relative_config=False)\n\n    # Application Configuration\n    app.config.from_object('config.Config')\n\n    # Initialize Plugins\n    db.init_app(app)\n    login_manager.init_app(app)\n\n    with app.app_context():\n        # Import parts of our application\n        from . import routes\n        from . import login\n        app.register_blueprint(routes.main_bp)\n        app.register_blueprint(login.login_bp)\n\n        # Initialize Global db\n        db.create_all()\n\n        return app\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In the above example, we're using the minimal number of plug-ins to get logins working: <strong>Flask-SQLAlchemy</strong> and <strong>Flask-Login</strong>.</p><p>To keep our sanity, we're going to separate our login routes from our main application routes and logic.

We'll come back to these in a moment</p><h2 id=\"creating-a-user-model\">Creating a User Model</h2><p>We'll save our <strong>User</strong> model in <code>models.py</code>. There are a few things to keep in mind when creating models compatible with Flask-Login- the most important being the utilization of <code>UserMixin</code> from the <code>flask_login</code> library. When we inherit our class from <strong>UserMixin,</strong> our model is immediately extended to include all the methods necessary for Flask-Login to work. This is by far the easiest way of creating a User model. I won't bother getting into details of what these methods do, because if you simply begin your class with <code>class User(UserMixin, db.Model):</code>, you genuinely don't need to understand any of it:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-python\">from . import db\nfrom flask_login import UserMixin\nfrom werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash\n\n\nclass User(UserMixin, db.Model):\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;Model for user accounts.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n\n    __tablename__ = 'flasklogin-users'\n\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer,\n                   primary_key=True,\n                   )\n    name = db.Column(db.String,\n                     nullable=False,\n                     unique=False)\n    email = db.Column(db.String(40),\n                      unique=True,\n                      nullable=False\n                      )\n    password = db.Column(db.String(200),\n                         primary_key=False,\n                         unique=False,\n                         nullable=False\n                         )\n    website = db.Column(db.String(60),\n                        index=False,\n                        unique=False,\n                        nullable=True\n                        )\n    created_on = db.Column(db.DateTime,\n                           index=False,\n                           unique=False,\n                           nullable=True\n                           )\n    last_login = db.Column(db.DateTime,\n                           index=False,\n                           unique=False,\n                           nullable=True\n                           )\n\n    def set_password(self, password):\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;Create hashed password.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n        self.password = generate_password_hash(password, method='sha256')\n\n    def check_password(self, password):\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;Check hashed password.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n        return check_password_hash(self.password, password)\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return '&lt;User {}&gt;'.format(self.username)\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The <code>set_password</code> and <code>check_password</code> methods don't necessarily need to live inside our User model, but it's nice to keep related logic bundled together and out of our routes.</p><p>You may notice that our password field explicitly allows 200 characters: this is because our database will be storing hashed passwords.

If a user is returned, this signifies a logged-out user. Otherwise, when <code>None</code> is returned, the user is logged out.</p><p>Lastly, we have the <code>unauthorized</code> route, which uses the <code>unauthorized_handler</code> decorator for dealing with unauthorized users.

It's kind of a weird thing to be into,\nhence why the MoMA has been rejecting my submissions of Github repositories.\nDon't worry; I'll keep at it.\n\nSomething you don't see every day are people sharing their pipelines, which is\nunderstandable. Presumably, the other people who do this kind of stuff do it for\nwork; nobody is happily building stupid pipelines in their free time begging to\nbe open sourced. Except me.\n\nWe've recently revamped our projects [https://hackersandslackers.com/projects/] \npage to include a public-facing Kanban board using GraphQL. To achieve this, we\nneed to extract JIRA data from the JIRA Cloud REST API and place it securely in\nour database.\n\nStructuring our Pipeline\nAn ETL pipeline which is considered 'well-structured' is in the eyes of the\nbeholder. There are a million different ways to pull and mess with data, so\nthere isn't a \"template\" for building these things out. In my case, the\nstructure of my script just so happened to end up as three modules: one for \nextracting, one for loading, and one for transforming. This was unplanned, but\nit's a good sign when our app matches our mindset. Here's the breakdown:\n\njira-database-etl\n├── __main__.py\n├── jira_etl\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── fetch.py\n│   ├── data.py\n│   └── db.py\n├── LICENSE\n├── MANIFEST.in\n├── Pipfile\n├── Pipfile.lock\n├── README.md\n├── requirements.txt\n├── setup.cfg\n└── setup.py\n\n\nmain.py  is our application entry point. The logic of our pipeline is stored in\nthree parts under the jira_etl  directory:\n\n * fetch.py  grabs the data from the source (JIRA Cloud's REST API) and handles\n   fetching all JIRA issues.\n * data.py  transforms the data we've fetched and constructs a neat DataFrame\n   containing only the information we're after.\n * db.py  finally loads the data into a SQL database.\n\nDon't look into it too much, but here's our entry point:\n\nfrom jira_etl import fetch\nfrom jira_etl import data\nfrom jira_etl import db\n\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Application Entry Point.\n\n    1. Fetch all desired JIRA issues from an instance's REST API.\n    2. Sanitize the data and add secondary metadata.\n    3. Upload resulting DataFrame to database.\n    \"\"\"\n    jira_issues_json = fetch.FetchJiraIssues.fetch_all_results()\n    jira_issues_df = data.TransformData.construct_dataframe(jira_issues_json)\n    upload_status = db.DatabaseImport.upload_dataframe(jira_issues_df)\n    return upload_status\n\n\nWithout further adieu, let's dig into the logic!\n\nExtracting Our Data\nBefore doing anything, it's essential we become familiar with the data we're\nabout to pull. Firstly, JIRA's REST API returns paginated results which max out\nat 100 results per page. This means we'll have to loop through the pages\nrecursively until all results are loaded.\n\nNext, let's look at an example of a single  JIRA issue JSON object returned by\nthe API:\n\n{\n    \"expand\": \"names,schema\",\n    \"startAt\": 0,\n    \"maxResults\": 1,\n    \"total\": 888,\n    \"issues\": [\n        {\n            \"expand\":

That's a ton of BS for a single issue. You can see now why we'd want\nto transform this data before importing ten million fields into any database.\nMake note of these important fields:\n\n * startAt: An integer which tells us which issue number the paginated results\n   start at.\n * maxResults: Denotes the maximum number of results page - maxes out at 100\n   issues.\n * total: The total number of issues across all pages.\n * issues: A list of objects which contain the information for exactly one JIRA\n   issue per object\n\nGreat. So the purpose of fetch.py will essentially consist of creating a list of\nall 888  issues (in my case), and passing that off for transformation. Check it\nthe source I came up with:\n\nimport os\nimport math\nimport requests\n\n\nclass FetchJiraIssues:\n    \"\"\"Fetch all public-facing issues from JIRA instance.\n\n    1. Retrieve all values from env vars.\n    2. Construct request against JIRA REST API.\n    3. Fetch paginated issues via recursion.\n    4. Pass final JSON to be transformed into a DataFrame.\n     \"\"\"\n    results_per_page = 100\n    username = os.environ.get('JIRA_USERNAME')\n    password = os.environ.get('JIRA_PASSWORD')\n    endpoint = os.environ.get('JIRA_ENDPOINT')\n    jql = os.environ.get('JIRA_QUERY')\n    headers = {\n        \"Accept\": \"application/json\"\n    }\n\n    @classmethod\n    def get_total_number_of_issues(cls):\n        \"\"\"Gets the total number of results.\"\"\"\n        params = {\n            \"jql\": cls.jql,\n            \"maxResults\": 0,\n            \"startAt\": 0\n        }\n        req = requests.get(cls.endpoint,\n                           headers=cls.headers,\n                           params=params,\n                           auth=(cls.username, cls.password)\n                           )\n        response = req.json()\n        try:\n            total_results = response['total']\n            return total_results\n        except KeyError:\n            print('Could not find any issues!')\n\n    @classmethod\n    def fetch_all_results(cls):\n        \"\"\"Recursively retrieve all pages of JIRA issues.\"\"\"\n        total_results = cls.get_total_number_of_issues()\n        issue_arr = []\n\n        def fetch_single_page():\n            \"\"\"Fetch one page of results, and determine if another page exists.\"\"\"\n            params = {\n                \"jql\": cls.jql,\n                \"maxResults\": cls.results_per_page,\n                \"startAt\": len(issue_arr)\n            }\n            req = requests.get(cls.endpoint,\n                               headers=cls.headers,\n                               params=params,\n                               auth=(cls.username, cls.password)\n                               )\n            response = req.json()\n            issues = response['issues']\n            issues_so_far = len(issue_arr) + cls.results_per_page\n            print(issues_so_far, ' out of', total_results)\n            issue_arr.extend(issues)\n            # Check if additional pages of results exist.\n        count = math.ceil(total_results/cls.results_per_page)\n        for x in range(0, count):\n            fetch_single_page()\n        return issue_arr\n\n\nYep, I'm using classes. This class has two methods:\n\n * get_total_number_of_issues: All this does is essentially pull the number of\n   issues (888) from the REST API. We'll use this number in our next function to\n   check if additional pages exist.\n * fetch_all_results: This is where things start getting fun. fetch_all_results \n   is a @classmethod  which contains a function within itself. fetch_all_results \n    gets the total number of JIRA issues and then calls upon child function \n   fetch_single_page to pull JIRA issue JSON objects and dump them into a list\n   called issue_arr  until all issues are accounted for.\n\nBecause we have 888 issues and can retrieve 100 issues  at a time, our function\nfetch_single_page  should run 9 times. And it does!\n\nTransforming Our Data\nSo now we have a list of 888 messy JIRA issues. The scope of data.py  should be\nto pull out only the data we want, and make sure that data is clean:\n\nimport os\nimport json\nfrom pandas.io.json import json_normalize\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n\nclass TransformData:\n    \"\"\"Build JIRA issue DataFrame.\n\n    1. Loop through JIRA issues and create a dictionary of desired data.\n    2. Convert each issue dictionary into a JSON object.\n    3. Load all issues into a Pandas DataFrame.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    issue_count = 0\n\n    @classmethod\n    def construct_dataframe(cls, issue_list_chunk):\n        \"\"\"Make DataFrame out of data received from JIRA API.\"\"\"\n        issue_list = [cls.make_issue_body(issue) for issue in issue_list_chunk]\n        issue_json_list = [cls.dict_to_json_string(issue) for issue in issue_list]\n        jira_issues_df = json_normalize(issue_json_list)\n        return jira_issues_df\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def dict_to_json_string(issue_dict):\n        \"\"\"Convert dict to JSON to string.\"\"\"\n        issue_json_string = json.dumps(issue_dict)\n        issue_json = json.loads(issue_json_string)\n        return issue_json\n\n    @classmethod\n    def make_issue_body(cls, issue):\n        \"\"\"Create a JSON body for each ticket.\"\"\"\n        updated_date = datetime.strptime(issue['fields']['updated'], \"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f%z\")\n        body = {\n            'id': str(cls.issue_count),\n            'key': str(issue['key']),\n            'assignee_name': str(issue['fields']['assignee']['displayName']),\n            'assignee_url': str(issue['fields']['assignee']['avatarUrls']['48x48']),\n            'summary': str(issue['fields']['summary']),\n            'status': str(issue['fields']['status']['name']),\n            'priority_url': str(issue['fields']['priority']['iconUrl']),\n            'priority_rank': int(issue['fields']['priority']['id']),\n            'issuetype_name': str(issue['fields']['issuetype']['name']),\n            'issuetype_icon': str(issue['fields']['issuetype']['iconUrl']),\n            'epic_link': str(issue['fields']['customfield_10008']),\n            'project': str(issue['fields']['project']['name']),\n            'updated': int(datetime.timestamp(updated_date)),\n            'updatedAt': str(updated_date)\n        }\n        cls.issue_count += 1\n        return body\n\n\nAgain, let's see the methods at work:\n\n * construct_dataframe: The main function we invoke to build our DataFrame\n   (mostly just calls other methods). Once all transformations are completed,\n   creates a DataFrame called jira_df  by using the Pandas json_normalize() \n   method.\n * make_issue_body: Creates a new dictionary per singular JIRA issue. Extracts \n   only  the fields we want to be imported into our database. Converts each\n   field into either a string or an int as a lazy way of avoiding null values\n   (for example, if issue['fields']['priority']['name']  contained a null value,\n   the script would error out. Wrapping this in str() is a dirty way of\n   converting null  to an empty string).\n * dict_to_json_string  Takes each issue dictionary and converts it to a JSON\n   object, which is then turned into a string (this is done for Pandas).\n\nLoading Our Data\nAnd now for the final step! Thanks to the joyful marriage of Pandas and\nSQLAlchemy, turning DataFrames into SQL tables is super simple.

With our data\nclean, we can now build something useful! Here's what I built:\n\nFruits of our labor!There we have it: a pipeline that takes a bunch of messy\ndata, cleans it, and puts it somewhere else for proper use.\n\nIf you're interested in how we created the frontend for our Kanban board, check\nout our series on building features with GraphQL\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/series/graphql-hype/]. For the source code,\ncheck out the Github repository\n[https://github.com/toddbirchard/jira-database-etl].","html":"<p>Something we haven't done just yet on this site is walking through the humble process of creating data pipelines: the art of taking a bunch of data, changing said data, and putting it somewhere else. It's kind of a weird thing to be into, hence why the MoMA has been rejecting my submissions of Github repositories. Don't worry; I'll keep at it.</p><p>Something you don't see every day are people sharing their pipelines, which is understandable. Presumably, the other people who do this kind of stuff do it for work; nobody is happily building stupid pipelines in their free time begging to be open sourced. Except me.</p><p>We've recently revamped our <strong><a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/projects/\">projects</a></strong> page to include a public-facing Kanban board using GraphQL. To achieve this, we need to extract JIRA data from the JIRA Cloud REST API and place it securely in our database.</p><h2 id=\"structuring-our-pipeline\">Structuring our Pipeline</h2><p>An ETL pipeline which is considered 'well-structured' is in the eyes of the beholder. There are a million different ways to pull and mess with data, so there isn't a \"template\" for building these things out. In my case, the structure of my script just so happened to end up as three modules: one for <em>extracting</em>, one for <em>loading</em>, and one for <em>transforming</em>. This was unplanned, but it's a good sign when our app matches our mindset. Here's the breakdown:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-shell\">jira-database-etl\n├── __main__.py\n├── jira_etl\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── fetch.py\n│   ├── data.py\n│   └── db.py\n├── LICENSE\n├── MANIFEST.in\n├── Pipfile\n├── Pipfile.lock\n├── README.md\n├── requirements.txt\n├── setup.cfg\n└── setup.py\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>main.py</strong> is our application entry point. The logic of our pipeline is stored in three parts under the <strong>jira_etl</strong> directory:</p><ul><li><strong>fetch.py</strong> grabs the data from the source (JIRA Cloud's REST API) and handles fetching all JIRA issues.</li><li><strong>data.py</strong> transforms the data we've fetched and constructs a neat DataFrame containing only the information we're after.</li><li><strong>db.py</strong> finally loads the data into a SQL database.</li></ul><p>Don't look into it too much, but here's our entry point:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-python\">from jira_etl import fetch\nfrom jira_etl import data\nfrom jira_etl import db\n\n\ndef main():\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;Application Entry Point.\n\n    1.

Firstly, JIRA's REST API returns paginated results which max out at 100 results per page. This means we'll have to loop through the pages recursively until all results are loaded.</p><p>Next, let's look at an example of a <strong><em>single</em></strong> JIRA issue JSON object returned by

In the\npast, we've covered encoding location data from raw addresses\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/preparing-data-for-mapbox-geocoding/], as well\nas an exploration of Mapbox Studio\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/map-data-visualization-with-mapbox/]  for those\ngetting acquainted with the tool. Today we're going a step further: drawing\ndirections on a map.\n\nIt sounds simple enough: we already know how to geocode addresses, so all we\nneed to do is literally go from point A to point B. That said, things always\ntend to get tricky, and if you've never worked with GeoJSON\n[http://geojson.org/]  before, you're in for a treat.\n\nLoad Up Some Data\nI'm going to assume you have a DataFrame ready containing these columns:\n\n * origin_longitude\n * origin_latitude\n * destination_longitude\n * destination_latitude\n * Name/description of this route \n\nIf you want to play along, there are plenty of free datasets out there to play\nwith - I sourced some information from BigQuery while I was testing things out.\n\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nroutes_df = pd.read_csv('datasources/routes.csv').head(10)\ntoken = os.environ.get('mapbox_token')\n\n\nSo far so good- all we've done is load our data, and save our Mapbox token from\nan environment variable.\n\nMapbox Directions Endpoint\nNext, we're going to use Mapbox's Directions API\n[https://docs.mapbox.com/api/navigation/#directions]  to return a route for us.\nThe anatomy of a GET call to receive directions looks like this:\n\nhttps://api.mapbox.com/directions/v5/mapbox/{{method_of_transportation}}/{{origin_longitude}},{{origin_latitude}};{{destination_longitude}},{{destination_latitude}}\n\nPARAMS:\naccess_token={{your_mapbox_access_token}}\ngeometries=geojson\n\n\n * method_of_transportation refers to one of the three methods that Mapbox\n   offers for creating routes: driving-traffic, driving, walking, and cycling.\n   Note that there is currently no way to draw route objects which follow public\n   transit: this is perhaps Mapbox's biggest downfall at the moment.\n   Nevertheless, if this is something you need, data can be imported from Google\n   maps to be used with Mapbox.\n * access_token  can be either your public token (visible upon login at\n   mapbox.com) or a generated secret token.\n * geometries  accepts the method by which to draw the object. This can be \n   GeoJSON,  polyline, or polyline6. Let's stick with GeoJSON.\n\nConstructing API Requests\nLet's construct a request per row in our DataFrame. By using Pandas' apply, we\nfire a function per row to do just that:\n\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nroutes_df = pd.read_csv('datasources/routes.csv').head(10)\ntoken = os.environ.get('mapbox_token')\n\ndef create_route_json(row):\n    \"\"\"Get route JSON.\"\"\"\n    base_url = 'https://api.mapbox.com/directions/v5/mapbox/driving/'\n    url = base_url + str(row['home_longitude']) + \\\n        ',' + str(row['home_latitude']) + \\\n        ';' + str(row['destination_longitude']) + \\\n        ',' + str(row['destination_latitude'])\n    params = {\n        'geometries': 'geojson',\n        'access_token': token\n    }\n    req = requests.get(url, params=params)\n    route_json = req.json()['routes'][0]\n    # Now what?\n\n\nroutes_df.apply(create_route_json, axis=1)\n\n\nHere's where things get a little tricky. You see, GeoJSON abides by a strict\nformat. It looks something like this:\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"Feature\",\n  \"geometry\": {\n    \"coordinates\": [\n      [ -73.985897, 40.748133 ], [ -73.985046, 40.747773 ], \n      [ -73.984579, 40.748431 ], [ -73.973437, 40.743885 ],\n      [ -73.972844, 40.744452 ], [ -73.970728, 40.743885 ], \n      [ -73.970611, 40.735137 ], [ -73.9714, 40.733734 ],\n      [ -73.973503, 40.732341 ], [ -73.969823, 40.729864 ], \n      [ -73.969243, 40.727535 ], [ -73.975074, 40.711418 ],\n      [ -73.976603, 40.710276 ], [ -73.978077, 40.710587 ], \n      [ -73.979462, 40.70932 ], [ -73.992664, 40.708145 ],\n      [ -73.996237, 40.707307 ], [ -74.001135, 40.704086 ], \n      [ -74.0055, 40.70243 ], [ -74.006778, 40.703628 ],\n      [ -74.009173, 40.702484 ], [ -74.010637, 40.70371 ], \n      [ -74.014535, 40.703624 ], [ -74.014665, 40.704034 ],\n      [ -74.017057, 40.703259 ]\n    ],\n    \"type\": \"LineString\"\n  },\n  \"legs\": [{\n      \"summary\": \"\",\n      \"weight\": 3873.3,\n      \"duration\": 3873.3,\n      \"steps\": [],\n      \"distance\": 9660.2\n  }],\n  \"weight_name\": \"duration\",\n  \"weight\": 3873.3,\n  \"duration\": 3873.3,\n  \"distance\": 9660.2,\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"name\": \"Empire State\"\n  }\n}\n\n\nFor the sake of being difficult, the Mapbox Directions API doesn't return\nresponses in exactly this format.

Of course, we're still doing this one at a time, for every row in our\nDataFrame.\n\nYou'll notice I save each JSON file locally for now. In the future, we'll write\na script to automate the process of uploading our GeoJSON objects and adding\nthem to the proper Tilesets, but right now I just want to see that our work paid\noff!\n\nBy using Mapbox studio, we can see the result of our first route:\n\nA \"Driving\" Route from the Empire State Building to Battery Park.Aha! Would you\nlook at that- Mapbox knew to take the FDR drive. That's some promising stuff.\n\nDrawing Routes En Masse\nNaturally, this is only the tip of the iceberg: of the DataFrame of information\nwe loaded up, we've so far only viewed a single result. If anything in data is\nworth doing, it must be done thousands of times systematically without fail.\nLuckily, Mapbox provides us with the tools to do this: from lending us an S3\nbucket, to modifying datasets via the API, there's nothing to fear.\n\nTune in next time when do more... stuff!","html":"<p>If you've been here before, you probably already know our affinity for <strong>Mapbox</strong> and the visualization tools it provides data scientists and analysts.

In this particular case it wasn't my personal life in\ndanger, but rather the life of this very blog. I will allow for a brief pause\nwhile the audience shares gasps of disbelief. We must stay strong and collect\nourselves from such distress.\n\nLike most things I despise, the source of this unnecessary headache was a SaaS\nproduct. I won't name any names here, but it was Cloudinary. Yep, totally them.\nWe'd been using their (supposedly) free service for hosting our blog's images\nfor about a month now. This may be a lazy solution to a true CDN, sure, but\nthere's only so much we can do when well over half of Ghost's 'officially\nrecommended' storage adapters are depreciated or broken. That's a whole other\nthing.\n\nI'll spare the details, but at some point we reached one of the 5 or 6 rate\nlimits on our account which had conveniently gone unmentioned (official\nviolations include storage, bandwidth, lack of galactic credits, and a refusal\nto give up Park Place from the previously famous McDonalds Monopoly game-\nseriously though, why not ask for Broadway)? The terms were simple: pay 100\ndollars of protection money to the sharks a matter of days. Or, ya know, don't.\n\nWeapons Of Mass Content Delivery\nHostage situations aside, the challenge was on: how could move thousands of\nimages to a new CDN within hours of losing all  of our data, or without\nexperiencing significant downtime? Some further complications:\n\n * There’s no real “export” button on Cloudinary. Yes, I know,  they’ve just\n   recently released some rest API that may or may not generate a zip file of a\n   percentage of your files at a time. Great. \n * We’re left with 4-5 duplicates of every image. Every time a transform is\n   applied to an image, it leaves behind unused duplicates.\n * We need to revert to the traditional YYYY/MM folder structure, which was\n   destroyed.\n\nThis is gonna be good. You'd be surprised what can be Macgyvered out of a single\nPython Library and a few SQL queries. Let's focus on Boto3  for now.\n\nBoto3: It's Not Just for AWS Anymore\nDigitalOcean  offers a dead-simple CDN service which just so happens to be fully\ncompatible with Boto3. Let's not linger on that fact too long before we consider\nthe possibility that DO is just another AWS reseller. Moving on.\n\nInitial Configuration\nSetting up Boto3 is simple just as long as you can manage to find your API key\nand secret:\n\nimport json\nimport boto3\nfrom botocore.client import Config\n\n# Initialize a session using DigitalOcean Spaces.\nsession = boto3.session.Session()\nclient = session.client('s3',\n                        region_name='nyc3',\n                        endpoint_url='https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com',\n                        aws_access_key_id=os.environ.get('KEY'),\n                        aws_secret_access_key=os.environ.get('SECRET'))\n\n\nFrom here forward, whenever we need to reference our 'bucket', we do so via \nclient.\n\nFast Cut Back To Our Dramatic Storyline\nIn our little scenario, I took a first stab at populating our bucket as a rough \npass. I created our desired folder structure and tossed everything we owned\nhastily into said folders, mostly by rough guesses and by gauging the publish\ndate of posts. So we've got our desired folder structure, but the content is a \nmess.\n\nCDN\n├── Posts\n│   ├── /2017\n│   │   ├── 11\n│   ├── /2018\n│   │   ├── 03\n│   │   ├── 04\n│   │   ├── 05\n│   │   ├── 06\n│   │   ├── 07\n│   │   ├── 08\n│   │   ├── 09\n│   │   ├── 10\n│   │   ├── 11\n│   │   └── 12\n│   ├── /2019\n│   │   ├── 01\n│   │   └── 02\n│   └── /lynx\n├── /bunch\n├── /of\n├── /other\n└── /shit\n\n\nSo we're dealing with a three-tiered folder hierarchy here. You're probably\nthinking \"oh great, this is where we recap some basics about recursion for the\n1ooth time...\" but you're wrong!  Boto3 deals with the pains of recursion for us\nif we so please. If we were to run client.list_objects_v2()  on the root of our\nbucket, Boto3 would return the file path of every single file in that bucket\nregardless of where it lives.\n\nLetting an untested script run wild and make transformations to your production\ndata sounds like fun and games, but I'm not willing to risk losing the hundreds \nof god damned Lynx pictures I draw every night for a mild sense of amusement.\nInstead, we're going to have Boto3 loop through each folder one at a time so\nwhen our script does  break, it'll happen in a predictable way that we can just\npick back up. I guess that means.... we're pretty much opting into recursion.\nFine, you were right.\n\nThe Art of Retrieving Objects\nRunning client.list_objects_v2()  sure sounded straightforward when I omitted\nall the details, but this method can achieve some quite powerful things for its\nsize. list_objects_v2 is essentially our bread and butter behind this script.\n\"But why list_objects_v2 instead of list_objects,\"  you may ask? I don't know,\nbecause AWS is a bloated shit show? Does Amazon even know? Why don't we ask\ntheir documentation?\n\nWell that explains... Nothing.Well, I'm sure list_objects had a vulnerability or something. Surely it's been\nsunsetted by now. Anything else just wouldn't make any sense.\n\n...Oh. It's right there. Next to version 2.That's the last time I'll mention\nthat AWS sucks in this post... I promise.\n\nGetting All Folders in a Subdirectory\nTo humor you, let's see what getting all objects in a bucket would look like:\n\ndef get_everything_ever():\n    \"\"\"Retrieve all folders underneath the specified directory.\"\"\"\n    get_folder_objects = client.list_objects_v2(\n        Bucket='hackers',\n        Delimiter='',\n        EncodingType='url',\n        MaxKeys=1000,\n        Prefix='/',\n        ContinuationToken='',\n        FetchOwner=False,\n        StartAfter=''\n      )\n\n\nWe've passed pretty much nothing meaningful to list_objects_v2(), so it will\ncome back to us with every file, folder, woman and child it can find in your\npoor bucket with great vengeance and furious anger:\n\noh god oh god oh godHere, I'll even be fair and only return the file names/paths\ninstead of each object:\n\nAh yes, totally reasonable for thousands of files.Instead, we'll solve this like\nGentlemen.

Now let's look at a brief catalog of\nwhat we could potentially do here.\n\nChoose Your Own Adventure\nPurge Files We Know Are Trash\nThis is an easy one. Surely your buckets get bloated with unused garbage over\ntime... in my example, I somehow managed to upload a bunch of duplicate images\nfrom my Dropbox, all with the suffix  (Todds-MacBook-Pro.local's conflicted copy\nYYYY-MM-DD). Things like that can be purged easily:\n\ndef purge_unwanted_objects(item):\n    \"\"\"Delete item from bucket if name meets criteria.\"\"\"\n    banned = ['Todds-iMac', 'conflicted', 'Lynx']\n    if any(x in item for x in banned):\n        client.delete_object(Bucket=\"hackers\", Key=item)\n        return True\n    return False\n\n\nDownload CDN Locally\nIf we want to apply certain image transformations, it could be a good idea to\nback up everything in our CDN locally. This will save all objects in our CDN to\na relative path which matches the folder hierarchy of our CDN; the only catch is\nwe need to make sure those folders exist prior to running the script:\n\n...\nimport botocore\n\ndef save_images_locally(obj):\n    \"\"\"Download target object.\n\n    1. Try downloading the target object.\n    2. If image doesn't exist, throw error.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        client.download_file(Key=obj, Filename=obj, Bucket='hackers')\n    except botocore.exceptions.ClientError as e:\n        if e.response['Error']['Code'] == \"404\":\n            print(\"The object does not exist.\")\n        else:\n            raise\n\n\nCreate Retina Images\nWith the Retina.js  plugin, serving any image of filename x.jpg  will also look\nfor a corresponding file name x@2x.jpg  to serve on Retina devices. Because our\nimages are exported as high-res, all we need to do is write a function to copy\neach image and modify the file name:\n\ndef create_retina_image(item):\n    \"\"\"Rename our file to specify that it is a Retina image.\n\n    1. Insert \"@2x\" at end of filename.\n    2. Copy original image with new filename.\n    3. Keep both files as per retina.js.\n    \"\"\"\n    indx = item.index('.')\n    newname = item[:indx] + '@2x' + item[indx:]\n    newname = sanitize_object_key(newname)\n    client.copy_object(Bucket='hackers',\n                       CopySource='hackers/' + item,\n                       Key=newname)\n    print(\"created: \", newname)\n\n\nCreate Standard Resolution Images\nBecause we started with high-res images and copied them, we can now scale down\nour original images to be normal size. resize_width()  is a method of the \nresizeimage  library which scales the width of an image while keeping the\nheight-to-width aspect ratio in-tact. There's a lot happening below, such as\nusing io  to 'open' our file without actually downloading it, etc:\n\n...\nimport PIL\n\ndef create_standard_res_image(obj):\n    \"\"\"Resizes large images to an appropriate size.\n\n    1. Set maximum bounds for standard-def image.\n    2. Get the image file type.\n    3. Open the local image.\n    4. Resize image.\n    5.

Moving on.</p><h3 id=\"initial-configuration\">Initial Configuration</h3><p>Setting up Boto3 is simple just as long as you can manage to find your API key and secret:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">import json\nimport boto3\nfrom botocore.client import Config\n\n# Initialize a session using DigitalOcean Spaces.\nsession = boto3.session.Session()\nclient = session.client('s3',\n                        region_name='nyc3',\n                        endpoint_url='https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com',\n                        aws_access_key_id=os.environ.get('KEY'),\n                        aws_secret_access_key=os.environ.get('SECRET'))\n</code></pre>\n<p>From here forward, whenever we need to reference our 'bucket', we do so via <code>client</code>.</p><h3 id=\"fast-cut-back-to-our-dramatic-storyline\">Fast Cut Back To Our Dramatic Storyline</h3><p>In our little scenario, I took a first stab at populating our bucket as a <em><strong>rough </strong></em>pass. I created our desired folder structure and tossed everything we owned hastily into said folders, mostly by rough guesses and by gauging the publish date of posts. So we've got our desired folder structure, but the content is a <strong>mess</strong>.</p><pre><code class=\"language-shell\">CDN\n├── Posts\n│   ├── /2017\n│   │   ├── 11\n│   ├── /2018\n│   │   ├── 03\n│   │   ├── 04\n│   │   ├── 05\n│   │   ├── 06\n│   │   ├── 07\n│   │   ├── 08\n│   │   ├── 09\n│   │   ├── 10\n│   │   ├── 11\n│   │   └── 12\n│   ├── /2019\n│   │   ├── 01\n│   │   └── 02\n│   └── /lynx\n├── /bunch\n├── /of\n├── /other\n└── /shit\n</code></pre>\n<p>So we're dealing with a three-tiered folder hierarchy here. You're probably thinking \"oh great, this is where we recap some basics about recursion for the 1ooth time...\" but you're <strong>wrong!</strong> Boto3 deals with the pains of recursion for us if we so please. If we were to run <code>client.list_objects_v2()</code> on the root of our bucket, Boto3 would return the file path of every single file in that bucket regardless of where it lives.</p><p>Letting an untested script run wild and make transformations to your production data sounds like fun and games, but I'm not willing to risk losing the <em>hundreds</em> of god damned Lynx pictures I draw every night for a mild sense of amusement. Instead, we're going to have Boto3 loop through each folder one at a time so when our script <em>does</em> break, it'll happen in a predictable way that we can just pick back up. I guess that means.... we're pretty much opting into recursion. Fine, you were right.</p><h2 id=\"the-art-of-retrieving-objects\">The Art of Retrieving Objects</h2><p>Running <code>client.list_objects_v2()</code> sure sounded straightforward when I omitted all the details, but this method can achieve some quite powerful things for its size. <strong>list_objects_v2 </strong>is essentially our bread and butter behind this script. \"But why <strong>list_objects_v2 </strong>instead of <strong>list_objects,\"</strong> you may ask? I don't know, because AWS is a bloated shit show? Does Amazon even know? Why don't we ask their documentation?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://hackers.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/posts/2019/02/list_objects_2.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Well that explains...

Surely your buckets get bloated with unused garbage over time... in my example, I somehow managed to upload a bunch of duplicate images from my Dropbox, all with the suffix<strong> (Todds-MacBook-Pro.local's conflicted copy YYYY-MM-DD)</strong>.

Like most major\nPython libraries, SQLAlchemy has been ported into a version specifically\ncompatible with Flask, aptly named Flask-SQLAlchemy.\n\nSimilar to the core SQLAlchemy package, Flask-SQLAlchemy provides an ORM for us\nto modify application data by easily creating defined models. Regardless of what\nyour database of choice might be, Flask-SQLAlchemy will ensure that the models\nwe create in Python will translate to the syntax of our chosen database. Given\nthe ease-of-use and one-size-fits-all  nature of Flask-SQLAlchemy, it's no\nwonder that the library has been the de facto database library of choice for\nFlask since the very beginning (seriously, is there even another option?)\n\nConfiguring Flask-SQLAlchemy For Your Application\nThere are a few essential configuration variables we need to set upfront before\ninteracting with our database. As is standard, we'll be using a class defined in\n config.py  to handle our Flask config:\n\nimport os\n\n\nclass Config:\n    \"\"\"Set Flask configuration vars from .env file.\"\"\"\n    \n    # General\n    TESTING = os.environ[\"TESTING\"]\n    FLASK_DEBUG = os.environ[\"FLASK_DEBUG\"]\n\n    # Database\n    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get(\"SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI\")\n    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = os.environ.get(\"SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS\")\n\n\nLet's break these down:\n\n * SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI: the connection string we need to connect to our\n   database. This follows the standard convention: \n   [db_type]+[db_connector]://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[db_name]\n * SQLALCHEMY_ECHO: When set to 'True', Flask-SQLAlchemy will log all database\n   activity to Python's stderr for debugging purposes.\n * SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS: Honestly, I just always set this to 'False,'\n   otherwise an obnoxious warning appears every time you run your app reminding\n   you that this option takes a lot of system resources.\n\nThose are the big ones we should worry about. If you're into some next-level\ndatabase shit, there are a few other pro-mode configuration variables which you\ncan find here [http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.3/config/].\n\nBy using the exact naming conventions for the variables above, simply having\nthem in our config file will automatically configure our database connections\nfor us. We will never have to create engines, sessions, or connections.\nInitiating Flask-SQLAlchemy With Our App\nAs always, we're going to use the Flask Application Factory method\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/structuring-your-flask-app/]  for initiating our\napp. If you're unfamiliar with the term, you're going to find this tutorial to\nbe confusing and pretty much useless.\n\nThe most basic __init__.py  file for Flask applications using Flask-SQLAlchemy\nshould look like this:\n\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n\ndb = SQLAlchemy()\n\n\ndef create_app():\n    \"\"\"Construct the core application.\"\"\"\n    app = Flask(__name__, instance_relative_config=False)\n    db.init_app(app)\n    app.config.from_object('config.Config')\n\n    with app.app_context():\n        # Imports\n        from . import routes\n        \n        # Create tables for our models\n        db.create_all()\n\n        return app\n\n\nNote the presence of db  and its location: this our database object being set as\na global  variable outside of create_app(). Inside of create_app(), on the other\nhand, contains the line db.init_app(app). Even though we've set our db object\nglobally, this means nothing until we initialize it after creating our\napplication. We accomplish this by calling init_app()  within create_app(), and\npassing our app as the parameter. Within the actual 'application context' is\nwhere we'll call create_all(), which we'll cover in a bit.\n\nIf that last paragraph sounded like total gibberish to you, you are not alone. \nThe Flask Application Factory is perhaps one of the most odd and poorly\nexplained concepts in Python software development- my best advice is to not\nbecome frustrated, take the copy + paste code above, and blindly accept the\nspoon-fed nonsense enough times until it becomes second nature. That's what I\ndid, and even as I worked through this tutorial, I still  came across obnoxious\nquirks that caught me off-guard.\n\nTake note of import we make inside of the application context called routes.\nThis is one of two files we haven't written just yet: once we create them, our\napplication file structure will look something like this:\n\nmy-app\n├── /application\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── routes.py\n│   ├── models.py\n├── .env\n├── config.py\n└── wsgi.py\n\n\nCreating Database Models\nCreate a models.py  file in our application directory. Here we'll import the db \nobject that we created in __init__.py. Now we can create database models by\ndefining classes in this file.\n\nA common example would be to start with a User  model. The first variable we\ncreate is __tablename__, which will correspond to the name of the SQL table new\nusers will be saved. Each additional variable we create within this model class\nwill correspond a column in the database:\n\nfrom . import db\n\n\nclass User(db.Model):\n    \"\"\"Model for user accounts.\"\"\"\n\n    __tablename__ = 'users'\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer,\n                   primary_key=True\n                   )\n    username = db.Column(db.String(64),\n                         index=False,\n                         unique=True,\n                         nullable=False\n                         )\n    email = db.Column(db.String(80),\n                      index=True,\n                      unique=True,\n                      nullable=False\n                      )\n    created = db.Column(db.DateTime,\n                        index=False,\n                        unique=False,\n                        nullable=False\n                        )\n    bio = db.Column(db.Text,\n                    index=False,\n                    unique=False,\n                    nullable=True\n                    )\n    admin = db.Column(db.Boolean,\n                      index=False,\n                      unique=False,\n                      nullable=False\n                      )\n    \n    def __repr__(self):\n        return '<User {}>'.format(self.username)\n\n\nEach \"column\" accepts the following attributes:\n\n * Data Type:  Accepts one of the following: String(size), Text, DateTime, Float\n   , Boolean, PickleType, or LargeBinary.\n * primary_key: Whether or not the column should serve as the primary key.\n * unique: Whether or not to enforce unique values for the column.\n * nullable: Denotes required fields.\n\nWith our first model created, you're already way closer to interacting with your\ndatabase than you might think.\n\nCreating Our First Entry\nLet's create a user in our routes.py  file.\n\nfrom flask import request, render_template, make_response\nfrom datetime import datetime as dt\nfrom flask import current_app as app\nfrom .models import db, User\n\n\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])\ndef entry():\n    \"\"\"Endpoint to create a user.\"\"\"\n    new_user = User(username='myuser',\n                    email='myuser@example.com',\n                    created=dt.now(),\n                    bio=\"In West Philadelphia born and raised, on the playground is where I spent most of my days\",\n                    admin=False\n                    )\n    db.session.add(new_user)\n    db.session.commit()\n    return make_response(\"User created!\")\n\n\nCheck out how easy this is! All it takes to create a user is create an instance\nof the User  class from models.py, add it to our session via \ndb.session.add(new_user), and commit the changes with db.session.commit()! Let's\nsee what happens when we run this app:\n\nUser Created!\n\n\nThat's what we like to see! If we access our database at this point, we can see\nthat this exact record was created in our users  table.\n\nQuerying Our New Data\nCreating information is dope, but how can we confirm it exists? I've added a few\nthings to routes.py  to show us what's up:\n\nfrom flask import request, render_template\nfrom datetime import datetime as dt\nfrom flask import current_app as app\nfrom .models import db, User\n\n\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])\ndef entry():\n    \"\"\"Endpoint to create a user.\"\"\"\n    new_user = User(username='myuser',\n                    email='myuser@example.com',\n                    created=dt.now(),\n                    bio=\"In West Philadelphia born and raised, on the playground is where I spent most of my days\",\n                    admin=False\n                    )\n    db.session.add(new_user)\n    db.session.commit()\n    users = User.query.all()\n    return render_template('users.html', users=users, title=\"Show Users\")\n\n\n  The statement User.query.all()  will return all instances of User  in our\ndatabase. I created a Jinja template to show us all records nicely:\n\n{% extends \"layout.html\" %}\n\n{% block content %}\n  {% for user in users %}\n    <ul id=\"user.username\">\n      <li>Username: {{ user.username }}</li>\n      <li>Email: {{ user.email }}</li>\n      <li>Created: {{ user.created }}</li>\n      <li>Bio: {{ user.bio }}</li>\n      <li>Admin: {{ user.admin }}</li>\n    </ul>\n  {% endfor %}\n{% endblock %}\n\n\nThus, our app gives us:\n\nWe have liftoff!So we can get a single user, but what about a whole table full\nof users? Well, all we need to do is keep changing the username and email\naddress (our unique keys, to avoid a clash) when firing up the app, and each\ntime it runs, it'll create a new user. Here's what comes back after running the\napp a few times with different values:\n\nI Can't Believe It's Not Error Messages.™Here, Take All My Stuff\nSure, Flask-SQLAlchemy is great once you get going, but as we've already seen\n\"getting set up\" isn't always a walk in the park. This is one of those things\nthat always seems to be wrong no matter how many times you've done it from\nmemory.\n\nAs a parting gift, I've put the source for this tutorial up on Github\n[https://github.com/toddbirchard/flasksqlalchemy-tutorial]  for you to treasure\nand enjoy. No seriously, take it. Get it away from me. I'm done with Flask for\ntoday.

With most enterprises comfortably settled into their Apache-based Big\nData stacks, BigQuery rattles the cages of convention for many. Luckily, Hackers\nAnd Slackers is no such enterprise. Thus, we aren't afraid to ask the Big\nquestion: how much easier would life be with BigQuery?\n\nBig Data, BigQuery\nIn short, BigQuery trivializes the act of querying against multiple,\nunpredictable data sources. To better understand when this is useful, it would\nbetter serve us to identify the types of questions BigQuery can answer. Such as:\n\n * What are our users doing across our multiple systems? How do we leverage log\n   files outputted by multiple systems to find out?\n * How can we consolidate information about employee information, payroll, and\n   benefits, when these all live in isolated systems?\n * What the hell am I supposed to do with all these spreadsheets?\n\nUnlike previous solutions, BigQuery solves these problems in a single product\nand does so with SQL-like query syntax,  a web interface, and 7 native Client\nLibraries.  There are plenty of reasons to love BigQuery, but let's start with\none we've recently already talked about: the auto-generation of table schemas. \n\nMatt has demonstrated how to approach this problem manually with the help of\nPandas\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/downcast-numerical-columns-python-pandas/]. I\nprovided a more gimmicky approach by leveraging the Python table-schema library\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/infer-datatypes-from-csvs-to-create/]. With\nBigQuery, we find yet another alternative which is neither manual or gimmicky:\nperfect for those who are lazy, rich, and demand perfection (AKA: your clients,\nprobably).\n\nFirst, we'll need to get our data into BigQuery\n\nUploading Data into Google Cloud Storage via the Python SDK\nBigQuery requires us to go through Google Cloud Storage as a buffer before\ninputting data into tables. No big deal, we'll write a script!\n\nWe're assuming that you have a basic knowledge of Google Cloud, Google Cloud\nStorage, and how to download a JSON Service Account key\n[https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries]  to store locally\n(hint: click the link).\n\nfrom google.cloud import storage\n\nbucket_uri = 'gs://your-bucket/'\nbucket_name = 'your-bucket'\nbucket_target = 'datasets/data_upload.csv'\nlocal_dataset = 'data/test.csv'\n\n\ndef upload_blob(bucket_name, source_file_name, destination_blob_name):\n    \"\"\"Upload a CSV to Google Cloud Storage.\n\n    1. Retrieve the target bucket.\n    2. Set destination of data to be uploaded.\n    3. Upload local CSV.\n    \"\"\"\n    storage_client = storage.Client()\n    bucket = storage_client.get_bucket(bucket_name)\n    blob = bucket.blob(destination_blob_name)\n    # Commence Upload\n    blob.upload_from_filename(source_file_name)\n    print('File {} uploaded to {}.'.format(\n        source_file_name,\n        destination_blob_name))\n        \n        \nupload_blob(bucket_name, local_dataset, bucket_target)\n\n\nThe above is nearly a copy + paste of Google Cloud's sample code for the Google\nCloud Storage Python SDK:\n\n * bucket_uri  is found by inspecting any bucket's information on Google Cloud.\n * bucket_name  is... well, you know.\n * bucket_target  represents the resulting file structure representing the saved\n   CSV when completed.\n * local_dataset  is the path to a CSV we've stored locally: we can assume that\n   we've grabbed some data from somewhere, like an API, and tossed into a local\n   file temporarily.\n\nSuccessfully executing the above results in the following message:\n\nFile data/test.csv uploaded to datasets/data_upload.csv.\n\n\nInserting Data from Cloud Storage to BigQuery\nThat was the easy part. Let's move on to the good stuff:\n\nfrom google.cloud import storage\nfrom google.cloud import bigquery\n\nbucket_uri = 'gs://your-bucket/'\nbucket_name = 'your-bucket'\nbucket_target = 'datasets/data_upload.csv'\nlocal_dataset = 'data/test.csv'\nbucket_target_uri = bucket_uri + bucket_target\nbigquery_dataset = 'uploadtest'\nbigquery_table = 'my_table'\n\n\ndef upload_blob(bucket_name, source_file_name, destination_blob_name):\n    \"\"\"Upload a CSV to Google Cloud Storage.\n\n    1.

In BigQuery, tables can\nbelong to a 'dataset,' which is a grouping of tables. Compare this concept to\nMongoDB's collections, or PostgreSQL's schemas. Note that this process is made\nmuch easier by the fact that we stored our project key locally: otherwise, we'd\nhave to specify which Google Cloud project we're looking for, etc.\n\nWith the dataset specified, we begin to build our \"job\" object with \nLoadJobConfig. This is like loading a gun before unleashing a shotgun blast into\nthe face of our problems. Alternatively, a more relevant comparison could be\nwith the Python requests  library and the act of prepping an API request before\nexecution.\n\nWe set job_config.autodetect  to be True, obviously. \njob_config.skip_leading_rows  reserves our header row from screwing things up.\n\nload_job  puts our request together, and load_job.result()  executes said job.\nThe .result()  method graciously puts the rest of our script on hold until the\nspecified job is completed. In our case, we want this happen: it simplifies our\nscript so that we don't need to verify this manually before moving on.\n\nLet's see what running that job with our fake data looks like in the BigQuery\nUI:\n\nAll my fake friends are here!Getting Our Flawlessly Inferred Table Schema\nBigQuery surely gets table schemas wrong some of the time. That said, I have yet\nto see it happen.

With most enterprises comfortably settled into their Apache-based Big Data stacks, BigQuery rattles the cages of convention for many. Luckily, Hackers And Slackers is no such enterprise. Thus, we aren't afraid to ask the Big question: how much easier would life be with BigQuery?</p><h2 id=\"big-data-bigquery\">Big Data, BigQuery</h2><p>In short, BigQuery trivializes the act of querying against multiple, unpredictable data sources. To better understand when this is useful, it would better serve us to identify the types of questions BigQuery can answer. Such as:</p><ul><li>What are our users doing across our multiple systems? How do we leverage log files outputted by multiple systems to find out?</li><li>How can we consolidate information about employee information, payroll, and benefits, when these all live in isolated systems?</li><li>What the hell am I supposed to do with all these spreadsheets?</li></ul><p>Unlike previous solutions, BigQuery solves these problems in a single product and does so with <strong>SQL-like query syntax,</strong> a <strong>web interface</strong>, and <strong>7 native Client Libraries.</strong> There are plenty of reasons to love BigQuery, but let's start with one we've recently already talked about: the <em>auto-generation of table schemas</em>. </p><p>Matt has demonstrated how to approach this problem <a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/downcast-numerical-columns-python-pandas/\">manually with the help of Pandas</a>. I provided a more gimmicky approach by leveraging the <a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/infer-datatypes-from-csvs-to-create/\">Python table-schema library</a>. With BigQuery, we find yet another alternative which is neither manual or gimmicky: perfect for those who are lazy, rich, and demand perfection (AKA: your clients, probably).</p><p>First, we'll need to get our data into BigQuery</p><h2 id=\"uploading-data-into-google-cloud-storage-via-the-python-sdk\">Uploading Data into Google Cloud Storage via the Python SDK</h2><p>BigQuery requires us to go through Google Cloud Storage as a buffer before inputting data into tables.

by using strict types (instead of normal Python \"duck\ntyping\"), you can do things a lot faster.  The float64  is the most flexible\nnumerical type - it can handle fractions, as well as turning missing values into\na NaN.  This will let us read it into memory, and then start messing with it.\n The downside is that it consumes a lot of memory.\n\nNow, let's say we want to save memory by manually downcasting our columns into\nthe smallest type that can handle its values?  And let's ALSO say that we want\nto be really, really lazy and don't want to look at a bunch of numbers by hand.\n And let's say we wanna do this via Method Chaining, because of all the\nadvantages outlined here: https://tomaugspurger.github.io/method-chaining\n\nLet's introduce our example DataFrame.  We'll convert all the values to floats\nmanually because that's what the default is when we read from a file.\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"stay_float\": [0.5, 3.7, 7.5],\n    \"to_int\": [-5, 7, 5],\n    \"to_uint\": [1, 100, 200]}).astype(float)\n\n\nFirst, let's introduce the workhorse of this exercise - Pandas's to_numeric \nfunction, and its handy optional argument, downcast.  This will take a numerical\ntype - float, integer  (not int), or unsigned  - and then downcast it to the\nsmallest version available.\n\nNext, let's make a function that checks to see if a column can be downcast from\na float to an integer.\n\ndef float_to_int(ser):\n    try:\n        int_ser = ser.astype(int)\n        if (ser == int_ser).all():\n            return int_ser\n        else:\n            return ser\n    except ValueError:\n        return ser\n\nWe're using the try/except pattern here because if we try to make a column with \nNaN  values into an integer column, it'll throw an error.  If it'd otherwise be\na good candidate for turning into an integer, we should figure a value to impute\nfor those missing values - but that'll be different for every column.  Sometimes\nit'd make sense to make it 0, other times the mean or median of the column, or\nsomething else entirely.\n\nI'd also like to direct your attention to Line 4, which has a very useful Pandas\npattern -

we reduced it by more than 1/3rd!","html":"<p>Recently, I had to find a way to reduce the memory footprint of a Pandas DataFrame in order to actually do operations on it.  Here's a trick that came in handy!</p><p>By default, if you read a DataFrame from a file, it'll cast all the numerical columns as the <code>float64</code> type.  This is in keeping with the philosophy behind Pandas and NumPy - by using strict types (instead of normal Python \"duck typing\"), you can do things a lot faster.  The <code>float64</code> is the most flexible numerical type - it can handle fractions, as well as turning missing values into a <code>NaN</code>.  This will let us read it into memory, and then start messing with it.  The downside is that it consumes a lot of memory.</p><p>Now, let's say we want to save memory by manually downcasting our columns into the smallest type that can handle its values?  And let's ALSO say that we want to be really, really lazy and don't want to look at a bunch of numbers by hand.  And let's say we wanna do this via Method Chaining, because of all the advantages outlined here: <a href=\"https://tomaugspurger.github.io/method-chaining\">https://tomaugspurger.github.io/method-chaining</a></p><p>Let's introduce our example DataFrame.  We'll convert all the values to floats manually because that's what the default is when we read from a file.</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">df = pd.DataFrame({\n    &quot;stay_float&quot;: [0.5, 3.7, 7.5],\n    &quot;to_int&quot;: [-5, 7, 5],\n    &quot;to_uint&quot;: [1, 100, 200]}).astype(float)\n</code></pre>\n<p>First, let's introduce the workhorse of this exercise - Pandas's <code>to_numeric</code> function, and its handy optional argument, <code>downcast</code>.  This will take a numerical type - <code>float</code>, <code>integer</code> (not <code>int</code>), or <code>unsigned</code> - and then downcast it to the smallest version available.</p><p>Next, let's make a function that checks to see if a column can be downcast from a float to an integer.</p><pre><code>def float_to_int(ser):\n    try:\n        int_ser = ser.astype(int)\n        if (ser == int_ser).all():\n            return int_ser\n        else:\n            return ser\n    except ValueError:\n        return ser</code></pre><p>We're using the try/except pattern here because if we try to make a column with <code>NaN</code> values into an integer column, it'll throw an error.  If it'd otherwise be a good candidate for turning into an integer, we should figure a value to impute for those missing values - but that'll be different for every column.  Sometimes it'd make sense to make it 0, other times the mean or median of the column, or something else entirely.</p><p>I'd also like to direct your attention to Line 4, which has a very useful Pandas pattern - <code>if (ser == int_ser).all()</code>.  When you do operations on Pandas columns like Equals or Greater Than, you get a new column where the operation was applied element-by-element.  If you're trying to set up a conditional, the interpreter doesn't know what to do with an array containing <code>[True, False, True]</code> -

The\narticle was titled Creating Database Schemas: a Job for Robots, or Perhaps\nPandas. It was my intent at the time to solve a common annoyance: creating\ndatabase tables out of raw data, without the obnoxious process of explicitly\nsetting each column's datatype. I had a few leads that led me to believe I had\nthe answer... boy was I wrong.\n\nThe task seems somewhat reasonable from the surface. Surely we can spot columns\nwhere the data is always in integers, or match the expected format of a date,\nright? If anything, we'll fall back to text  or varchar  and call it a day.\nHell, even MongoDB's Compass does a great job of this by merely uploading a\nCSV... this has got to be some trivial task handled by third-party libraries by\nnow.\n\nFor one reason or another, searching for a solution to this problem almost\nalways comes up empty. Software developers probably have little need for\ndynamically generated tables if their applications run solely on self-defined\nmodels. Full-time Data Scientists have access to plenty of expensive tools which\nseem to claim this functionality, yet it all seems so... inaccessible.\n\nIs This NOT a Job For Pandas?\nFrom my experience, no.

What is this garbage? Only one of our 11 columns identified a data\ntype, and it was incorrectly listed as a float! Okay, so maybe Pandas doesn't\nhave a secret one-liner for this. So who does?\n\nWhat about PySpark?\nIt's always been a matter of time before we'd turn to Apache's family of aged\ndata science products. Hadoop, Spark, Kafka... all of them have a particular\nmusty stench about them that tastes like \"I feel like I should be writing in\nJava right now.\" Heads up: they do  want you to write in Java. Misery loves\ncompany.\n\nNonetheless, PySpark  does  support reading data as DataFrames in Python, and\nalso comes with the elusive ability to infer schemas. Installing Hadoop and\nSpark locally still kind of sucks for solving this one particular problem. Cue \nDatabricks [https://databricks.com/]: a company that spun off from the Apache\nteam way back in the day, and offers free cloud notebooks integrated with- you\nguessed it: Spark.\n\nWith Databricks, we can upload our CSV and load it into a DataFrame by spinning\nup a free notebook. The source looks something like this:\n\n# File location and type\nfile_location = \"/FileStore/tables/fake.csv\"\nfile_type = \"csv\"\n\n# CSV options\ninfer_schema = \"true\"\nfirst_row_is_header = \"true\"\ndelimiter = \",\"\n\ndf = spark.read.format(file_type) \\\n  .option(\"inferSchema\", infer_schema) \\\n  .option(\"header\", first_row_is_header) \\\n  .option(\"sep\", delimiter) \\\n  .load(file_location)\n\ndisplay(df)\n\n\nLet's see out the output looks:\n\ndf:pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame\nid:integer\ninitiated:timestamp\nhiredate:string\nemail:string\nfirstname:string\nlastname:string\ntitle:string\ndepartment:string\nlocation:string\ncountry:string\ntype:string\n\n\nNot bad! We correctly 'upgraded' our ID from float to integer, and we managed to\nget the timestamp correct also. With a bit of messing around, we could probably\nhave even gotten the date correct too, given that we stated the format\nbeforehand.\n\nA look at the Databricks Notebook interface.And Yet, This Still Kind of Sucks\nEven though we can solve our problem in a notebook, we still haven't solved the\nuse case: I want a drop-in solution to create tables out of CSVs... whenever I\nwant! I want to accomplish this while writing any app, at the drop of a hat\nwithout warning. I don't want to install Hadoop and have Java errors coming back\nat me through my terminal. Don't EVER  let me see Java in my terminal.

That brings us to tableschema\n[https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-py], a\nnot-quite-perfect-but-perhaps-good-enough library to gunsling data like some\nkind of wild data cowboy. Let's give it a go:\n\nimport csv\nfrom tableschema import Table\n\n\ndata = 'data/fake.csv'\nschema = infer(data, limit=500, headers=1, confidence=0.85)\nprint(schema)\n\n\nIf our dataset is particularly large, we can use the limit  attribute to limit\nthe sample size to the first X  number of rows. Another nice feature is the \nconfidence  attribute: a 0-1 ratio for allowing casting errors during the\ninference. Here's what comes back:\n\n{\n  \"fields\": [{\n    \"name\": \"id\",\n    \"type\": \"integer\",\n    \"format\": \"default\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"initiated\",\n    \"type\": \"string\",\n    \"format\": \"default\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"hiredate\",\n    \"type\": \"date\",\n    \"format\": \"default\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"email\",\n    \"type\": \"string\",\n    \"format\": \"default\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"firstname\",\n    \"type\": \"string\",\n    \"format\": \"default\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"lastname\",\n    \"type\": \"string\",\n    \"format\": \"default\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"title\",\n    \"type\": \"string\",\n    \"format\": \"default\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"department\",\n    \"type\": \"string\",\n    \"format\": \"default\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"location\",\n    \"type\": \"string\",\n    \"format\": \"default\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"country\",\n    \"type\": \"string\",\n    \"format\": \"default\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"type\",\n    \"type\": \"string\",\n    \"format\": \"default\"\n  }],\n  \"missingValues\": [\"\"]\n}\n\n\nHey, that's good enough for me! Now let's automate the shit out this.\n\nCreating a Table in SQLAlchemy With Our New Schema\nI'm about to throw a bunch in your face right here. Here's a monster of a class:\n\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nimport config\nimport pandas as pd\nimport psycopg2\nfrom tableschema import Table, infer, Schema\nfrom functions.recursivejson import extract_values\nfrom sqlalchemy.types import Integer, Text, Date\n\n\nclass CreateTablesFromCSVs:\n    \"\"\"Infer a table schema from a CSV.\"\"\"\n\n    __uri = config.PG_URI\n    __engine = create_engine(__uri, convert_unicode=True, echo=True)\n    __data = 'data/fake.csv'\n    \n    @classmethod\n    def get_data(cls):\n        \"\"\"Pull latest data.\"\"\"\n        test_df = pd.read_csv(cls.__data, header=0, encoding='utf-8')\n        return test_df\n\n    @classmethod\n    def get_schema_from_csv(cls, csv):\n        \"\"\"Infers schema from CSV.\"\"\"\n        table = Table(csv)\n        table.infer(limit=500, confidence=0.55)\n        schema = table.schema.descriptor\n        names = cls.get_column_names(schema, 'name')\n        datatypes = cls.get_column_datatypes(schema, 'type')\n        schema_dict = dict(zip(names, datatypes))\n        return schema_dict\n\n    @classmethod\n    def get_column_names(cls, schema, key):\n        \"\"\"Get names of columns.\"\"\"\n        names = extract_values(schema, key)\n        return names\n\n    @classmethod\n    def get_column_datatypes(cls, schema, key):\n        \"\"\"Convert schema to recognizable by SQLAlchemy.\"\"\"\n        values = extract_values(schema, key)\n        for i, value in enumerate(values):\n            if value == 'integer':\n                values[i] = Integer\n            elif value == 'string':\n                values[i] = Text\n            elif value == 'date':\n                values[i] = Date\n        return values\n        \n    @classmethod\n    def create_new_table(cls, data, schema):\n          \"\"\"Create new table from CSV and generated schema.\"\"\"\n          workday_table.to_sql('faketable',\n                               con=cls.__engine,\n                               schema='testschema',\n                               if_exists='replace',\n                               chunksize=300,\n                               dtype=schema)\n                                 \ndata = CreateTablesFromCSVs.get_schema_from_csv()\nschema = CreateTablesFromCSVs.get_schema_from_csv(data)\nCreateTablesFromCSVs.create_new_table(data, schema)\n\n\nThe first thing worth mentioning is I'm importing a function\n[https://gist.github.com/toddbirchard/b6f86f03f6cf4fc9492ad4349ee7ff8b]  from my\npersonal secret library to extract values from JSON objects. I've spoken about\nit before\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/extract-data-from-complex-json-python/]. \n\nLet's break down this class:\n\n * get_data()  reads our CSV into a Pandas DataFrame.\n * get_schema_from_csv()  kicks off building a Schema that SQLAlchemy can use to\n   build a table.\n * get_column_names()  simply pulls column names as half our schema.\n * get_column_datatypes()  manually replaces the datatype names we received from\n    tableschema  and replaces them with SQLAlchemy datatypes.\n * create_new_table  Uses a beautiful marriage between Pandas and SQLAlchemy to\n   create a table in our database with the correct datatypes mapped.\n\nPromising Potential, Room to Grow\nWhile tableschema  works some of the time, it isn't perfect. The base of what we\naccomplish still stands: we now have a reliable formula for how we would create\nschemas on the fly if we trust our schemas to be accurate.\n\nJust wait until next time when we introduce Google BigQuery  into the mix.","html":"<p>Back in August of last year (roughly 8 months ago), I hunched over my desk at 4 am desperate to fire off a post before boarding a flight the next morning. The article was titled <strong><em>Creating Database Schemas: a Job for Robots, or Perhaps Pandas</em></strong>. It was my intent at the time to solve a common annoyance: creating database tables out of raw data, without the obnoxious process of explicitly setting each column's datatype. I had a few leads that led me to believe I had the answer... boy was I wrong.</p><p>The task seems somewhat reasonable from the surface. Surely we can spot columns where the data is always in integers, or match the expected format of a date, right? If anything, we'll fall back to <strong>text</strong> or <strong>varchar</strong> and call it a day. Hell, even MongoDB's Compass does a great job of this by merely uploading a CSV... this has got to be some trivial task handled by third-party libraries by now.</p><p>For one reason or another, searching for a solution to this problem almost always comes up empty. Software developers probably have little need for dynamically generated tables if their applications run solely on self-defined models. Full-time Data Scientists have access to plenty of expensive tools which seem to claim this functionality, yet it all seems so... inaccessible.</p><h2 id=\"is-this-not-a-job-for-pandas\">Is This NOT a Job For Pandas?</h2><p>From my experience, no.

The source looks something like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\"># File location and type\nfile_location = &quot;/FileStore/tables/fake.csv&quot;\nfile_type = &quot;csv&quot;\n\n# CSV options\ninfer_schema = &quot;true&quot;\nfirst_row_is_header = &quot;true&quot;\ndelimiter = &quot;,&quot;\n\ndf = spark.read.format(file_type) \\\n  .option(&quot;inferSchema&quot;, infer_schema) \\\n  .option(&quot;header&quot;, first_row_is_header) \\\n  .option(&quot;sep&quot;, delimiter) \\\n  .load(file_location)\n\ndisplay(df)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's see out the output looks:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">df:pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame\nid:integer\ninitiated:timestamp\nhiredate:string\nemail:string\nfirstname:string\nlastname:string\ntitle:string\ndepartment:string\nlocation:string\ncountry:string\ntype:string\n</code></pre>\n<p>Not bad! We correctly 'upgraded' our ID from float to integer, and we managed to get the timestamp correct also. With a bit of messing around, we could probably have even gotten the date correct too, given that we stated the format beforehand.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/Screen-Shot-2019-01-22-at-8.41.30-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>A look at the Databricks Notebook interface.</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"and-yet-this-still-kind-of-sucks\">And Yet, This Still Kind of Sucks</h3><p>Even though we can solve our problem in a notebook, we still haven't solved the use case: I want a drop-in solution to create tables out of CSVs... whenever I want!

It was the software’s combination of power\nand ease-of-use that drove me to purchase a license in the first place. Ever\nsince then, I’m finding new and exciting ways Tableau intentionally locks users\nout of their data. \n\nI gave the Tableau Server Client Python library\n[https://tableau.github.io/server-client-python/docs/]  a spin recently in hopes\nof finding something useful. I decided to (sigh, once more) allow Tableau the\nbenefit of the doubt: after pushing four updates in a single month, maybe things\nhad changed. On the contrary, the Tableau business strategy stands strong: to be\na raging, flaming turd pile. A perfect example of this is the View  object\nTableau allows you to interact with on your server. Those familiar know that \nviews  are slang for sheets  of workbooks  stored on Tableau server. \n\nConnecting to your Tableau instance via Python to retrieve your view objects is\na piece of cake:\n\nimport tableauserverclient as TSC\ntableau_auth = TSC.TableauAuth('username', 'password')\nserver = TSC.Server('http://servername')\n\nwith server.auth.sign_in(tableau_auth):\n  all_views, pagination_item = server.views.get()\n  print([view.name for view in all_views])\n\n\nThis simple snippet lists every view object on your server. Wow! Think of what\nwe can do with all that tabular data we worked so hard to transform, rig- WRONG.\nLook at what Tableau's Python 'View Object' actually contains:\n\n * id  The identifier of the view item.\n * name  The name of the view.\n * owner_id  The id for the owner of the view.\n * preview_image  The thumbnail image for the view.\n * total_views  The usage statistics for the view. Indicates the total number of\n   times the view has been accessed.\n * workbook_id  The id of the workbook associated with the view.\n\nHOLY MOSES STOP THE PRESSES, we can get a thumbnail image  of our data?! THANK\nYOU GENEROUS TABLEAU OVERLORDS!\n\nNotice how there's no mention of, you know, the actual data.\n\nWe're going to play a game. In the wake of my time has been wasted, I feel that\nwarm tickling feeling which seems to say \"Viciously dismantle the ambitions of\nan establishment!\"  May I remind you, we're talking about the kind of\nestablishment that bills customer licenses based on the number of CPUs being\nutilized by their server infrastructure.  This is effectively recognizing the\nhorrifying and inefficient codebase behind Tableau server, and leveraging this\nflaw for monetization. Yes, you're paying more money to incentivize worst\npractices.\n\nLet's Make a Flask App. An Angry One.\nIn our last post I shared a little script to help you get started stealing data\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/tableaus-rest-api-turning-tableau-into-an-etl-pipeline-gui/] \n off your own Tableau Server. That doesn't quite scratch my itch anymore. I'm\ngoing to build an interface. I want to make it easy as possible for anybody to\nsystemically rob Tableau Server of every penny its got. That's a lot of pennies\nwhen we consider the equation: data = oil + new.\n\nBefore I bore you, here's a quick demo of the MVP we're building:\n\nEach table is a view being pulled from Tableau Server.This POC demonstrates that\nit is very  possible to automate the extraction of Tableau views from Tableau\nServer. The success  message is signaling that we've successfully taken a\nTableau view and created a corresponding table in an external database. Any data\nwe manipulate in Tableau is now truly ours: we can now leverage the transforms\nwe've applied in workbooks, use this data in other applications, and utilize an\nextract scheduler to keep the data coming. We've turned a BI tool into an ETL\ntool. In other words, you can kindly take those thumbnail previews and shove it.\n\nI'll be open sourcing all of this, as is my civic duty. Let us be clear to\nenterprises: withholding freedom to one's own data is an act of war. Pricing\nmodels which reward poor craftsmanship are an insult to our intellect.

I can't tell incompetence from malicious intent at this point.\n\nHere's a method breakdown of our class:\n\n * initialize_tableau_request(): Handles initial auth and returns valuable\n   information such as site ID and API Token to be used thereafter.\n * get_site(): Extracts the site ID from XML returned by the above.\n * get_token(): Similarly extracts our token.\n * list_views(): Compiles a list of all views within a Tableau site, giving us a\n   chance to select ones for extraction.\n * get_view(): Takes a view of our choice and creates a DataFrame, which is to\n   be shipped off to a foreign database.\n\nOur Routing Logic\nMoving on we have routes.py  building the views and associated logic for our\napp:\n\nfrom flask import current_app as app\nfrom flask import render_template, Blueprint, request, Markup\nfrom flask_assets import Bundle, Environment\nfrom . import tableau\nfrom . import database\nimport pandas as pd\n\nhome_blueprint = Blueprint('home', __name__, template_folder='templates', static_folder='static')\n\nassets = Environment(app)\njs = Bundle('js/*.js', filters='jsmin', output='dist/packed.js')\nscss = Bundle('scss/*.scss', filters='libsass', output='dist/all.css')\nassets.register('scss_all', scss)\nassets.register('js_all', js)\nscss.build()\njs.build()\n\n\n@home_blueprint.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef entry():\n    \"\"\"Homepage which lists all available views.\"\"\"\n    tableau_view_extractor = tableau.ExtractTableauView()\n    xml = tableau_view_extractor.initialize_tableau_request()\n    token = tableau_view_extractor.get_token(xml)\n    site = tableau_view_extractor.get_site(xml)\n    views = tableau_view_extractor.list_views(site, xml, token)\n    return render_template(\n        'index.html',\n        title=\"Here are your views.\",\n        template=\"home-template\",\n        views=views,\n        token=token,\n        xml=xml,\n        site=site\n    )\n\n\n@home_blueprint.route('/view', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef view():\n    \"\"\"Displays a preview of a selected view.\"\"\"\n    site = request.args.get('site')\n    xml = request.args.get('xml')\n    view = request.args.get('view')\n    token = request.args.get('token')\n    tableau_view_extractor = tableau.ExtractTableauView()\n    view_df = tableau_view_extractor.get_view(site, xml, view, token)\n    view_df.to_csv('application/static/data/view.csv')\n    return render_template(\n        'view.html',\n        title='Your View',\n        template=\"home-template\",\n        view=view,\n        token=token,\n        xml=xml,\n        site=site,\n        view_df=Markup(view_df.to_html(index=False))\n    )\n\n\n@home_blueprint.route('/export', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef export():\n    \"\"\"Exports view to external database.\"\"\"\n    view_df = pd.read_csv('application/static/data/view.csv')\n    view_df.to_sql(name='temp', con=database.engine, if_exists='replace', chunksize=50, index=True)\n    return render_template(\n        'export.html',\n        title='Success!',\n        template=\"success-template\",\n    )\n\n\nWe only have 3 pages to our application. They include our list of views, a\npreview of a single view, and a success page for when said view is exported.\nThis is all core Flask logic.\n\nPutting it On Display\nWe build our pages dynamically based on the values we pass our Jinja templates.\nThe homepage utilizes some nested loops to list the views we returned from \ntableau.py, and also makes use of query strings to pass values on to other\ntemplates.\n\n{% extends \"layout.html\" %}\n\n{% block content %}\n<div class=\"extended-container {{template}}\">\n  <div class=\"container\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col s12\">\n        <h1>{{title}}</h1>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col s12 flex-container\">\n        {% for view in views %}\n        <div class=\"download\">\n          <a href=\"{{ url_for('home.view') }}?token={{token}}&site={{site}}&view={{view.id}}&xml={{xml}}\">\n            <ul>\n              {% for key, value in view.items() %}\n              <li><span class=\"key {{key}}\">{{key}}</span> {{ value }}</li>\n              {% endfor %}\n            </ul>\n          </a>\n        </div>\n        {% endfor %}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  {% endblock %}\n\n\nMoving on: our humble view.html  page has two purposes: display the selected\nview, and export it in the name of justice.\n\n{% extends \"layout.html\" %}\n\n{% block content %}\n<div class=\"extended-container {{template}}\">\n  <div class=\"container\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col s12\">\n        <h1>{{title}}</h1>\n        <a href=\"{{ url_for('home.export') }}\" class=\"export\"><i class=\"far fa-file-export\"></i></a>\n        {{view_df}}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  {% endblock %}\n\n\nThe War is Not Over\nThis repository is open to the public and can be found here\n[https://github.com/toddbirchard/tableau-extraction]. There are still crusades\nleft ahead of us: for instance, building out this interface to accept\ncredentials via login as opposed to a config file, and the scheduling of view\nexports, as opposed to on-demand.\n\nWhere we go from here depends on what we the people decide. For all I know, I\ncould be shouting to an empty room here (I'm almost positive anybody who pays\nfor enterprise software prefers the blind eye of denial). If the opposite holds\ntrue, I dare say the revolution is only getting started.","html":"<p>I try my best not to hate on Tableau. It was the software’s combination of power and ease-of-use that drove me to purchase a license in the first place. Ever since then, I’m finding new and exciting ways Tableau intentionally locks users out of their data. </p><p>I gave the <a href=\"https://tableau.github.io/server-client-python/docs/\"><strong>Tableau Server Client</strong> Python library</a> a spin recently in hopes of finding something useful. I decided to (sigh, <em>once more</em>) allow Tableau the benefit of the doubt: after pushing <strong>four updates in a single month</strong>, maybe things had changed. On the contrary, the Tableau business strategy stands strong: to be a raging, flaming turd pile. A perfect example of this is the <strong>View</strong> object Tableau allows you to interact with on your server. Those familiar know that <strong>views</strong> are slang for <em>sheets</em> of <em>workbooks</em> stored on Tableau server. </p><p>Connecting to your Tableau instance via Python to retrieve your view objects is a piece of cake:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">import tableauserverclient as TSC\ntableau_auth = TSC.TableauAuth('username', 'password')\nserver = TSC.Server('http://servername')\n\nwith server.auth.sign_in(tableau_auth):\n  all_views, pagination_item = server.views.get()\n  print([view.name for view in all_views])\n</code></pre>\n<p>This simple snippet lists every view object on your server. Wow! Think of what we can do with all that tabular data we worked so hard to transform, rig- <strong>WRONG</strong>. Look at what Tableau's Python 'View Object' actually contains:</p><ul><li><code>id</code> The identifier of the view item.</li><li><code>name</code> The name of the view.</li><li><code>owner_id</code> The id for the owner of the view.</li><li><code>preview_image</code> The thumbnail image for the view.</li><li><code>total_views</code> The usage statistics for the view. Indicates the total number of times the view has been accessed.</li><li><code>workbook_id</code> The id of the workbook associated with the view.</li></ul><p>HOLY MOSES STOP THE PRESSES, we can get a <strong><em>thumbnail image</em></strong> of our data?! THANK YOU GENEROUS TABLEAU OVERLORDS!</p><p>Notice how there's no mention of, you know, the <em>actual data</em>.</p><p>We're going to play a game. In the wake of my time has been wasted, I feel that warm tickling feeling which seems to say <em>\"Viciously dismantle the ambitions of an establishment!\"</em> May I remind you, we're talking about the kind of establishment that bills customer licenses based on the <strong><em>number of CPUs being utilized by their server infrastructure.</em></strong> This is effectively recognizing the horrifying and inefficient codebase behind Tableau server, and leveraging this flaw for monetization. Yes, you're paying more money to incentivize worst practices.</p><h2 id=\"let-s-make-a-flask-app-an-angry-one-\">Let's Make a Flask App. An Angry One.</h2><p>In our last post I shared <a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/tableaus-rest-api-turning-tableau-into-an-etl-pipeline-gui/\">a little script to help you get started stealing data</a> off your own Tableau Server. That doesn't quite scratch my itch anymore. I'm going to build an interface. I want to make it easy as possible for anybody to systemically rob Tableau Server of every penny its got. That's a lot of pennies when we consider the equation: <strong>data = oil + new</strong>.</p><p>Before I bore you, here's a quick demo of the MVP we're building:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/tableau.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Each table is a view being pulled from Tableau Server.</figcaption></figure><p>This POC demonstrates that it is <em>very</em> possible to automate the extraction of Tableau views from Tableau Server. The <em>success</em> message is signaling that we've successfully taken a Tableau view and <strong>created a corresponding table in an external database</strong>. Any data we manipulate in Tableau is now truly ours: we can now leverage the transforms we've applied in workbooks, use this data in other applications, and utilize an extract scheduler to keep the data coming. We've turned a BI tool into an ETL tool. In other words, you can kindly take those thumbnail previews and shove it.</p><p>I'll be open sourcing all of this, as is my civic duty. Let us be clear to enterprises: withholding freedom to one's own data is an act of war. Pricing models which reward poor craftsmanship are an insult to our intellect. For every arrogant atrocity committed against consumers, the war will wage twice as hard.

I stand by that sentiment, but I’ll now directly contradict myself by\nsharing some tips on using vanilla Psycopg2  to interact with databases. \n\nWe never know when we’ll be stranded on a desert island without access to\nSQLAlchemy, but a lonesome Psycopg2 washes up on shore. Either that or perhaps\nyou’re part of a development team stuck in a certain way of doing things which\ndoesn't include utilize SQLAlchemy. Whatever the situation may be, we’re here\nfor you. \n\nThe Quintessential Boilerplate\nNo matter the type of database or the library, the boilerplate code for\nconnecting to databases remains mostly the same. To some extent, this even holds\ntrue across programming languages. Let's look at a barebones example while\nignoring the library at hand:\n\nimport SomeDatabaseLibrary\n\nclass Database:\n    \"\"\"A Generic Database class.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, config):\n        self.username = config.database('USERNAME')\n        self.password = config.database('PASSWORD')\n        self.host = config.database('HOST')\n        self.port = config.database('PORT')\n        self.db = config.database('DB')\n\n    def run_query(self, query):\n            conn = None\n            records = []\n            try:\n                conn = SomeDatabaseLibrary.connect(host=self.host, \n                                                user=self.username, \n                                                password=self.password,\n                                                port=self.port, \n                                                dbname=self.db)\n                with conn.cursor() as cur:\n                    cur.execute(query)\n                    result = cur.fetchall()\n                    for row in result:\n                        records.append(row)\n                    cur.close()\n                    return records\n            except (Exception, SomeDatabaseLibrary.DatabaseError) as error:\n                print(error)\n            finally:\n                if conn is not None:\n                    conn.close()\n                    print('Database connection closed.')\n\n\nIn the above example, we could swap SomeDatabaseLibrary  with either Psycopg2 \nor PyMySQL  just the same. If we compare this to our example with PyMySQL\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/using-pymysql/], it's easy to see that the\nbasics of utilizing connections, cursors, and the methods to close them\ntranscend libraries. If you know the basics of one, you know them all.\n\nIf you'd like to keep your connection logic separate (as I do), we can cleanly\nbreak the logic of handling connections out to a separate function. This time,\nwe'll replace SomeDatabaseLibrary  with Psycopg2  to produce some working code:\n\nimport psycopg2\n\nclass Database:\n    \"\"\"A Generic Database class.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, config):\n        self.username = config.database('USERNAME')\n        self.password = config.database('PASSWORD')\n        self.host = config.database('HOST')\n        self.port = config.database('PORT')\n        self.db = config.database('DB')\n        self.conn = None\n        \n    def open_connection():\n        \"\"\"Encapsulated connection management logic.\"\"\"\n        try:\n            if(self.conn is None):\n                self.conn = psycopg2.connect(host=self.host, \n                                       user=self.username, \n                                       password=self.password,\n                                       port=self.port, \n                                       dbname=self.db)\n            elif (not conn.open):\n                self.conn = psycopg2.connect(host=self.host, \n                                       user=self.username, \n                                       password=self.password,\n                                       port=self.port, \n                                       dbname=self.db)  \n        except:\n            logger.error(\"ERROR: Could not connect to Postgres.\")\n            sys.exit()\n\n    def run_query(self, query):\n            records = []\n            try:\n                open_connection()\n                with self.conn.cursor() as cur:\n                    cur.execute(query)\n                    result = cur.fetchall()\n                    for row in result:\n                        records.append(row)\n                    cur.close()\n                    return records\n            except (Exception, psycopg2.DatabaseError) as error:\n                print(error)\n            finally:\n                if conn is not None:\n                    conn.close()\n                    print('Database connection closed.')\n\n\nPsycopg2 Extras\nPsycopg2 has many useful features via a library called psycopg2.extras\n[http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/extras.html]. My personal favorite of these\nextras is the DictCursor, which renders the rows being returned by our query as\nPython dictionaries  as opposed to lists. \n\nUsing DictCursor to Return More Useful Results\nWhen using a DictCursor, the key  is always the column name, and the value is\nthe value of that column in that particular row.\n\nTo use extras, we import psycopg2.extras.\n\nThen, we turn our attention to the following line:\n\nself.conn.cursor() as cur:\n\n\nWithin cursor, we can pass an attribute named cursor_factory   and set it as\nsuch:\n\nconn.cursor(cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.DictCursor) as cur:\n\n\nWhile our cursor is open, all rows returned by the query will be returned as\ndictionaries. For example, the row  in the above example will be returned as a\ndict. To demonstrate, here's what a query on this exact post  you're reading now\nlooks like when returned as a Dict:\n\n{\n    title: \"Psycopg2: Postgres & Python the Old Fashioned Way\",\n    slug: \"psycopg2-postgres-python-the-old-fashioned-way\",\n    feature_image: \"https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/psycopg2.jpg\",\n    status: \"draft\",\n    created_at: \"2019-01-14 22:20:52\",\n    custom_excerpt: \"Managing Postgres Database connections with Psycopg2\"\n}\n\n\nCompare this to what we would've seen had we not used DictCursor:\n\n[\"Psycopg2: Postgres & Python the Old Fashioned Way\",\n\"psycopg2-postgres-python-the-old-fashioned-way\",\n\"https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/psycopg2.jpg\",\n\"draft\",\n\"2019-01-14 22:20:52\",\n\"Managing Postgres Database connections with Psycopg2\"]\n\n\nYes, it's a list, and thereby much less useful. Even from a readability\nstandpoint, I (the human user) have no idea what these values represent unless\ncomparing them to the table schema. Even worse would be compiling CSVs or even\nPandas Dataframes this way. When building a table made of lists, you set your\nheaders and hope that every row to come matches the number of header columns\none-to-one. Otherwise, it's entirely unclear as to which value belongs to which\ncolumn.\n\nOther Psycopg2 Extras\nThere are plenty more Psycopg2 extras where that came from; it's mostly up to\nyou to decide which are worth your while.\n\nFor example, another extra which might be of interest could be \npsycopg2.extras.LoggingConnection, useful for debugging connection statuses and\nerrors as you work through your program.\n\nThere's even a JSON Adaptation  extra, which provides support for leveraging\nJSON data in building queries:\n\ncur.execute(\"insert into mytable (jsondata) values (%s)\",\n    [Json({'a': 100})])\n\n\nI don't dwell too deep in Psycopg2 extras myself, but if you see any Godlike\nextras I'm missing, feel free to call them out in the COMMENTS BELOW!  (Hah!\nI've always wanted to say that).\n\nA Few More Fundamental Useful Things\nSomething worth visiting is the ability to upload CSVs into Postgres to create\ntables. We can accomplish this via the built-in method copy_expert.\n\nFrom CSV to Postgres Table\nTo save a CSV to Postgres table, we need to begin with a basic SQL query saved\nin our project as a variable:\n\nCOPY %s FROM STDIN WITH\n                    CSV\n                    HEADER\n                    DELIMITER AS ','\n\n\nAs should be familiar, %s  represents a value we can pass in later. With this\nraw query, we're only missing two more values:\n\n * The path of our CSV file to be uploaded\n * The name of the table we'd like to upload to in Postgres\n\nCheck out how we use copy_expert  here to put it all together:\n\nsql = \"COPY %s FROM STDIN WITH CSVHEADER DELIMITER AS ','\"\nfile = open('files/myfile.csv', \"r\")\ntable = 'my_postgres_table'\nwith conn.cursor() as cur:\n    cur.execute(\"truncate \" + table + \";\")\n    cur.copy_expert(sql=sql % table, file=file)\n    conn.commit()\n    cur.close()\n    conn.close()\n\n\nNotice that I opt to truncate the existing table before uploading the new data,\nas seen by cur.execute(\"truncate \" + table + \";\"). Without doing this, we would\nbe uploading the same CSV to the same table forever, creating duplicate rows\nover and over.\n\nWhat if The Table Doesn't Exist?\nUgh, of course  this would come up. The truth is (to the best of my knowledge),\nthere aren't many native things Psycopg2 has to offer to make this process easy.\n \n\nRecall that creating a table has a syntax similar to this:\n\nCREATE TABLE `recommended_reads` (\n  `id` bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\n  `title` varchar(150) NOT NULL,\n  `content` text,\n  `url` varchar(150) NOT NULL,\n  `created` int(11) NOT NULL,\n  `unique_ID` int(11) NOT NULL,\n  `image` varchar(150) DEFAULT NULL,\n  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),\n  UNIQUE KEY `id` (`id`),\n  UNIQUE KEY `uniqueid` (`unique_ID`) USING BTREE\n)\n\n\nIt's not impossible to build this string yourself in Python. It just entails a\nlot of iterating over whichever dynamic data structure you have coming through,\ndetermining the correct data type per column, and then the unavoidable task of\nsetting your Primary  and Unique  keys if applicable. This is where my patience\nends and knee-jerk reaction of \"would be easier in SQLAlchemy\" kicks in. Hey,\nit's possible! I just don't feel like writing about it. :).\n\nGodspeed to You, Brave Warrior\nFor those about to Psycopg2, we salute you. That is unless the choice is\nself-inflicted. In that case, perhaps it's best we don't work together any time\nsoon.","html":"<p>Last time we met, we joyfully <a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/pythonic-database-management-with-sqlalchemy/\">shared a little tirade</a> about missing out on functionality provided to us by libraries such as <strong>SQLAlchemy</strong>, and the advantages of interacting with databases where ORMs are involved. I stand by that sentiment, but I’ll now directly contradict myself by sharing some tips on using vanilla <strong>Psycopg2</strong> to interact with databases. </p><p>We never know when we’ll be stranded on a desert island without access to SQLAlchemy, but a lonesome Psycopg2 washes up on shore. Either that or perhaps you’re part of a development team stuck in a certain way of doing things which doesn't include utilize SQLAlchemy. Whatever the situation may be, we’re here for you. </p><h2 id=\"the-quintessential-boilerplate\">The Quintessential Boilerplate</h2><p>No matter the type of database or the library, the boilerplate code for connecting to databases remains mostly the same. To some extent, this even holds true across programming languages. Let's look at a barebones example while ignoring the library at hand:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">import SomeDatabaseLibrary\n\nclass Database:\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;A Generic Database class.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n\n    def __init__(self, config):\n        self.username = config.database('USERNAME')\n        self.password = config.database('PASSWORD')\n        self.host = config.database('HOST')\n        self.port = config.database('PORT')\n        self.db = config.database('DB')\n\n    def run_query(self, query):\n            conn = None\n            records = []\n            try:\n                conn = SomeDatabaseLibrary.connect(host=self.host, \n                                                user=self.username, \n                                                password=self.password,\n                                                port=self.port, \n                                                dbname=self.db)\n                with conn.cursor() as cur:\n                    cur.execute(query)\n                    result = cur.fetchall()\n                    for row in result:\n                        records.append(row)\n                    cur.close()\n                    return records\n            except (Exception, SomeDatabaseLibrary.DatabaseError) as error:\n                print(error)\n            finally:\n                if conn is not None:\n                    conn.close()\n                    print('Database connection closed.')\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the above example, we could swap <code>SomeDatabaseLibrary</code> with either <code>Psycopg2</code> or <code>PyMySQL</code> just the same. If we compare this to <a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/using-pymysql/\">our example with PyMySQL</a>, it's easy to see that the basics of utilizing <strong>connections</strong>, <strong>cursors</strong>, and the methods to close them transcend libraries. If you know the basics of one, you know them all.</p><p>If you'd like to keep your connection logic separate (as I do), we can cleanly break the logic of handling connections out to a separate function. This time, we'll replace <code>SomeDatabaseLibrary</code> with <code>Psycopg2</code> to produce some working code:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">import psycopg2\n\nclass Database:\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;A Generic Database class.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n\n    def __init__(self, config):\n        self.username = config.database('USERNAME')\n        self.password = config.database('PASSWORD')\n        self.host = config.database('HOST')\n        self.port = config.database('PORT')\n        self.db = config.database('DB')\n        self.conn = None\n        \n    def open_connection():\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;Encapsulated connection management logic.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n        try:\n            if(self.conn is None):\n                self.conn = psycopg2.connect(host=self.host, \n                                       user=self.username, \n                                       password=self.password,\n                                       port=self.port, \n                                       dbname=self.db)\n            elif (not conn.open):\n                self.conn = psycopg2.connect(host=self.host, \n                                       user=self.username, \n                                       password=self.password,\n                                       port=self.port, \n                                       dbname=self.db)  \n        except:\n            logger.error(&quot;ERROR: Could not connect to Postgres.&quot;)\n            sys.exit()\n\n    def run_query(self, query):\n            records = []\n            try:\n                open_connection()\n                with self.conn.cursor() as cur:\n                    cur.execute(query)\n                    result = cur.fetchall()\n                    for row in result:\n                        records.append(row)\n                    cur.close()\n                    return records\n            except (Exception, psycopg2.DatabaseError) as error:\n                print(error)\n            finally:\n                if conn is not None:\n                    conn.close()\n                    print('Database connection closed.')\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"psycopg2-extras\">Psycopg2 Extras</h2><p>Psycopg2 has many useful features via a library called <a href=\"http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/extras.html\">psycopg2.extras</a>. My personal favorite of these extras is the <code>DictCursor</code>, which renders the rows being returned by our query as Python <em>dictionaries</em> as opposed to <em>lists. </em></p><h3 id=\"using-dictcursor-to-return-more-useful-results\">Using DictCursor to Return More Useful Results</h3><p>When using a DictCursor, the <em>key</em> is always the column name, and the <em>value </em>is the value of that column in that particular row.</p><p>To use extras, we <code>import psycopg2.extras</code>.</p><p>Then, we turn our attention to the following line:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">self.conn.cursor() as cur:\n</code></pre>\n<p>Within <code>cursor</code>, we can pass an attribute named <code>cursor_factory</code>  and set it as such:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">conn.cursor(cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.DictCursor) as cur:\n</code></pre>\n<p>While our cursor is open, all rows returned by the query will be returned as dictionaries. For example, the <strong>row</strong> in the above example will be returned as a dict.

The nature of opening/closing DB connections and working with\ncursors hasn't changed much in the past few decades (nearly the lifespan of\nrelational databases themselves). While boilerplate is boring, at least it has\nremained consistent, one might figure. That may  have been the case, but the\nphilosophical boom of MVC frameworks nearly a decade ago sparked the emergence\nof popularity for ORMs. While the world was singing praises of object-oriented\nprogramming, containing database-oriented functionality within objects must have\nbeen a wet dream.\n\nThe only thing shocking about SQLAlchemy's popularity is its flip side: the\ncontingency of those functioning without  SQLAlchemy as a part of their regular\nstack. Whether this stems from unawareness or active reluctance to change, data\nteams using Python without a proper ORM are surprisingly prevalent. It's easy to\nforget the reality of the workforce when our interactions with other\nprofessionals come mostly from blogs published by those at the top of their\nfield.\n\nI realize the \"this is how we've always done it\" attitude is a cliché with no\nshortage of commentary. Tales of adopting new (relatively speaking) practices\ndominate Silicon Valley blogs every day- it's the manner in which this is\nmanifested, however, that catches me off guard. In this case, resistance to a\nsingle Python library can shed light on a frightening mental model that has\nimplications up and down a corporation's stack.\n\nPutting The 'M' In MVC\nFrameworks which enforce a Model-View-Controller have held undisputed consensus\nfor long enough: none of us need to recap why creating apps this way is\nunequivocally correct. To understand why side-stepping an ORM is so significant,\nlet's recall what ORM stands for:\n\n> Object-Relational Mapping, commonly referred to as its abbreviation ORM, is a\ntechnique that connects the rich objects of an application to tables in a\nrelational database management system. Using ORM, the properties and\nrelationships of the objects in an application can be easily stored and\nretrieved from a database without writing SQL statements directly and with less\noverall database access code. - Active Record\n[https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html]\nORMs allow us to interact with databases simply by modifying objects in code\n(such as classes) as opposed to generating SQL queries by hand for each database\ninteraction. Bouncing from application code to SQL is a major context switch,\nand the more interactions we introduce, the more out of control our app becomes.\n \n\nTo illustrate the alternative to this using models, I'll use an example offered\nby Flask-SQLAlchemy. Let's say we have a table of users which contains columns\nfor id, username,  and email. A model for such a table would look as such:\n\nclass User(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)\n    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return '<User %r>' % self.username\n\n\nThe 'model' is an object representing the structure of a single entry in our\ntable. Once our model exists, this is all it takes to create an entry:\n\nnewuser = User(username='admin', email='admin@example.com')\n\n\nThat's a single readable line of code without writing a single line of SQL.\nCompare this to the alternative, which would be to use Psycopg2:\n\nquery = \"INSERT INTO users VALUES username='admin', email='admin@example.com';\"\n\ndef query_function(query):\n  \"\"\"Runs a database query.\"\"\"\n  try:\n    conn = psycopg2.connect(\n      user = config.username,\n      password = config.password,\n      host = config.host,\n      port = config.port,\n      database = config.database)\n      with conn.cursor() as cur:\n         cur.execute(query)\n           cur.close()\n           conn.close()\n  except Exception as e:\n      print(e)\n        \nquery_function(query)\n\n\nSure, query_function()  only needs to be set once, but compare the readability\nof using a model to the following:\n\nquery = \"INSERT INTO users VALUES username='admin', email='admin@example.com';\"\n\nquery_function(query)\n\n\nDespite achieving the same effect, the latter is much less readable or\nmaintainable by human beings. Building an application around raw string queries\ncan quickly become a nightmare.\n\nIntegration With Other Data Libraries\nWhen it comes to golden standards of Python libraries, there is none more\nquintessential to data analysis than Pandas. The pairing of Pandas and\nSQLAlchemy is standard to the point where Pandas has built-in integrations to\ninteract with data from SQLAlchemy. Here's what it takes to turn a database\ntable into a Pandas dataframe with SQLAlchemy as our connector:\n\ndf = pd.read_sql(session.query(Table).filter(User.id == 2).statement,session.bind)\n\n\nOnce again, a single line of Python code!\n\nWriting Queries Purely in Python\nSo far by using SQLAlchemy, we haven't needed to write a single line of SQL: how\nfar could we take this? As far as we want, in fact. SQLAlchemy contains what\nthey've dubbed as function-based query construction, which is to say we can\nconstruct nearly any conceivable SQL query purely in Python by using the methods\noffered to us. For example, here's an update query:\n\nstmt = users.update().values(fullname=\"Fullname: \" + users.c.name)\nconn.execute(stmt)\n\n\nCheck the  full reference to see what I mean\n[https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/tutorial.html#inserts-and-updates].\nEvery query you've ever needed to write: it's all there. All of it.\n\nSimple Connection Management\nSeeing as how we all now agree that SQLAlchemy is beneficial to our workflow,\nlet's visit square one and see how simple it is to manage connections. The two\nkey words to remember here are engines  and sessions.\n\nThe Engine\nAn engine in SQLAlchemy is merely a bare-bones object representing our database.\nMaking SQLAlchemy aware of our database is as simple as these two lines:\n\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nengine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:', echo=True)\n\n\nThe Engine can interact with our database by accepting a simple URI. Once engine \n exists, we could in theory use engine exclusively via functions such as \nengine.connect()  and engine.execute().\n\nSessions\nTo interact with our database in a Pythonic manner via the ORM, we'll need to\ncreate a session  from the engine we just declared. Thus our code expands:\n\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n\nengine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:', echo=True)\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\n\n\nThat's all it takes! Now just as before, we can use SQLAlchemy's ORM and\nbuilt-in functions to make simple interacts:\n\nnew_user = User(name='todd', fullname='Todd Hacker', password='toddspassword')\nsession.add(new_user)\n\n\nTakeaway Goodies\nIt's worth mentioning that SQLAlchemy works with nearly every type of database,\nand does so by leveraging the base Python library for the respective type of\ndatabase. For example, it probably seems to the outsider that we've spent some\ntime shitting on Psycopg2. On the contrary, when SQLAlchemy connects to a\nPostgres database, it is using the Psycopg2 library under the hood to manage the\nboilerplate for us. The same goes for every other type of relational database\n[https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html]  along with their\nstandard libraries.\n\nThere are plenty of more reasons [https://www.sqlalchemy.org/features.html]  why\nSQLAlchemy is beneficial to the point where it is arguably critical to data\nanalysis workflows. The critical point to be made here is that leaving\nSQLAlchemy out of any data workflow only hurts the person writing the code, or\nmore importantly, all those who come after.","html":"<p>Something we've taken for granted thus far on Hackers and Slackers is a library most data professionals have accepted as an undisputed standard: <strong><a href=\"https://www.sqlalchemy.org/\">SQLAlchemy</a></strong>.</p><p>In the past, we've covered database connection management and querying using libraries such as <a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/using-pymysql/\"><strong>PyMySQL</strong></a> and <strong><a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/psycopg2-postgres-python-the-old-fashioned-way/\">Psycopg2</a></strong>, both of which do an excellent job of interacting with databases just as we'd expect them to. The nature of opening/closing DB connections and working with cursors hasn't changed much in the past few decades (nearly the lifespan of relational databases themselves). While boilerplate is boring, at least it has remained consistent, one might figure. That <strong><em>may</em></strong> have been the case, but the philosophical boom of MVC frameworks nearly a decade ago sparked the emergence of popularity for ORMs. While the world was singing praises of object-oriented programming, containing database-oriented functionality within objects must have been a wet dream.</p><p>The only thing shocking about SQLAlchemy's popularity is its flip side: the contingency of those functioning <em>without</em> SQLAlchemy as a part of their regular stack. Whether this stems from unawareness or active reluctance to change, data teams using Python without a proper ORM are surprisingly prevalent. It's easy to forget the reality of the workforce when our interactions with other professionals come mostly from blogs published by those at the top of their field.</p><p>I realize the \"this is how we've always done it\" attitude is a cliché with no shortage of commentary. Tales of adopting new (relatively speaking) practices dominate Silicon Valley blogs every day- it's the manner in which this is manifested, however, that catches me off guard. In this case, resistance to a single Python library can shed light on a frightening mental model that has implications up and down a corporation's stack.</p><h2 id=\"putting-the-m-in-mvc\">Putting The 'M' In MVC</h2><p>Frameworks which enforce a Model-View-Controller have held undisputed consensus for long enough: none of us need to recap why creating apps this way is unequivocally correct. To understand why side-stepping an ORM is so significant, let's recall what ORM stands for:</p><blockquote><em>Object-Relational Mapping, commonly referred to as its abbreviation ORM, is a technique that connects the rich objects of an application to tables in a relational database management system. Using ORM, the properties and relationships of the objects in an application can be easily stored and retrieved from a database without writing SQL statements directly and with less overall database access code. <strong>- <a href=\"https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html\">Active Record</a></strong></em></blockquote><p>ORMs allow us to interact with databases simply by modifying objects in code (such as classes) as opposed to generating SQL queries by hand for each database interaction. Bouncing from application code to SQL is a <em>major context switch</em>, and the more interactions we introduce, the more out of control our app becomes. </p><p>To illustrate the alternative to this using models, I'll use an example offered by <strong>Flask-SQLAlchemy</strong>. Let's say we have a table of users which contains columns for <strong>id, username,</strong> and <strong>email. </strong>A model for such a table would look as such:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-python\">class User(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)\n    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return '&lt;User %r&gt;' % self.username\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The 'model' is an object representing the structure of a single entry in our table. Once our model exists, this is all it takes to create an entry:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-python\">newuser = User(username='admin', email='admin@example.com')\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>That's a single readable line of code without writing a single line of SQL. Compare this to the alternative, which would be to use Psycopg2:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-python\">query = &quot;INSERT INTO users VALUES username='admin', email='admin@example.com';&quot;\n\ndef query_function(query):\n  &quot;&quot;&quot;Runs a database query.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n  try:\n    conn = psycopg2.connect(\n      user = config.username,\n      password = config.password,\n      host = config.host,\n      port = config.port,\n      database = config.database)\n      with conn.cursor() as cur:\n         cur.execute(query)\n           cur.close()\n           conn.close()\n  except Exception as e:\n      print(e)\n        \nquery_function(query)\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Sure, <code>query_function()</code> only needs to be set once, but compare the readability of using a model to the following:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-python\">query = &quot;INSERT INTO users VALUES username='admin', email='admin@example.com';&quot;\n\nquery_function(query)\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Despite achieving the same effect, the latter is much less readable or maintainable by human beings.
