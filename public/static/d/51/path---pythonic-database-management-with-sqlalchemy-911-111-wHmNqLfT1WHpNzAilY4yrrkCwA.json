The nature of opening/closing DB connections and working with\ncursors hasn't changed much in the past few decades (nearly the lifespan of\nrelational databases themselves). While boilerplate is boring, at least it has\nremained consistent, one might figure. That may  have been the case, but the\nphilosophical boom of MVC frameworks nearly a decade ago sparked the emergence\nof popularity for ORMs. While the world was singing praises of object-oriented\nprogramming, containing database-oriented functionality within objects must have\nbeen a wet dream.\n\nThe only thing shocking about SQLAlchemy's popularity is its flip side: the\ncontingency of those functioning without  SQLAlchemy as a part of their regular\nstack. Whether this stems from unawareness or active reluctance to change, data\nteams using Python without a proper ORM are surprisingly prevalent. It's easy to\nforget the reality of the workforce when our interactions with other\nprofessionals come mostly from blogs published by those at the top of their\nfield.\n\nI realize the \"this is how we've always done it\" attitude is a clichÃ© with no\nshortage of commentary. Tales of adopting new (relatively speaking) practices\ndominate Silicon Valley blogs every day- it's the manner in which this is\nmanifested, however, that catches me off guard. In this case, resistance to a\nsingle Python library can shed light on a frightening mental model that has\nimplications up and down a corporation's stack.\n\nPutting The 'M' In MVC\nFrameworks which enforce a Model-View-Controller have held undisputed consensus\nfor long enough: none of us need to recap why creating apps this way is\nunequivocally correct. To understand why side-stepping an ORM is so significant,\nlet's recall what ORM stands for:\n\n> Object-Relational Mapping, commonly referred to as its abbreviation ORM, is a\ntechnique that connects the rich objects of an application to tables in a\nrelational database management system. Using ORM, the properties and\nrelationships of the objects in an application can be easily stored and\nretrieved from a database without writing SQL statements directly and with less\noverall database access code. - Active Record\n[https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html]\nORMs allow us to interact with databases simply by modifying objects in code\n(such as classes) as opposed to generating SQL queries by hand for each database\ninteraction. Bouncing from application code to SQL is a major context switch,\nand the more interactions we introduce, the more out of control our app becomes.\n \n\nTo illustrate the alternative to this using models, I'll use an example offered\nby Flask-SQLAlchemy. Let's say we have a table of users which contains columns\nfor id, username,  and email. A model for such a table would look as such:\n\nclass User(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)\n    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return '<User %r>' % self.username\n\n\nThe 'model' is an object representing the structure of a single entry in our\ntable. Once our model exists, this is all it takes to create an entry:\n\nnewuser = User(username='admin', email='admin@example.com')\n\n\nThat's a single readable line of code without writing a single line of SQL.\nCompare this to the alternative, which would be to use Psycopg2:\n\nquery = \"INSERT INTO users VALUES username='admin', email='admin@example.com';\"\n\ndef query_function(query):\n  \"\"\"Runs a database query.\"\"\"\n  try:\n    conn = psycopg2.connect(\n      user = config.username,\n      password = config.password,\n      host = config.host,\n      port = config.port,\n      database = config.database)\n      with conn.cursor() as cur:\n         cur.execute(query)\n           cur.close()\n           conn.close()\n  except Exception as e:\n      print(e)\n        \nquery_function(query)\n\n\nSure, query_function()  only needs to be set once, but compare the readability\nof using a model to the following:\n\nquery = \"INSERT INTO users VALUES username='admin', email='admin@example.com';\"\n\nquery_function(query)\n\n\nDespite achieving the same effect, the latter is much less readable or\nmaintainable by human beings. Building an application around raw string queries\ncan quickly become a nightmare.\n\nIntegration With Other Data Libraries\nWhen it comes to golden standards of Python libraries, there is none more\nquintessential to data analysis than Pandas. The pairing of Pandas and\nSQLAlchemy is standard to the point where Pandas has built-in integrations to\ninteract with data from SQLAlchemy. Here's what it takes to turn a database\ntable into a Pandas dataframe with SQLAlchemy as our connector:\n\ndf = pd.read_sql(session.query(Table).filter(User.id == 2).statement,session.bind)\n\n\nOnce again, a single line of Python code!\n\nWriting Queries Purely in Python\nSo far by using SQLAlchemy, we haven't needed to write a single line of SQL: how\nfar could we take this? As far as we want, in fact. SQLAlchemy contains what\nthey've dubbed as function-based query construction, which is to say we can\nconstruct nearly any conceivable SQL query purely in Python by using the methods\noffered to us. For example, here's an update query:\n\nstmt = users.update().values(fullname=\"Fullname: \" + users.c.name)\nconn.execute(stmt)\n\n\nCheck the  full reference to see what I mean\n[https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/tutorial.html#inserts-and-updates].\nEvery query you've ever needed to write: it's all there. All of it.\n\nSimple Connection Management\nSeeing as how we all now agree that SQLAlchemy is beneficial to our workflow,\nlet's visit square one and see how simple it is to manage connections. The two\nkey words to remember here are engines  and sessions.\n\nThe Engine\nAn engine in SQLAlchemy is merely a bare-bones object representing our database.\nMaking SQLAlchemy aware of our database is as simple as these two lines:\n\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nengine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:', echo=True)\n\n\nThe Engine can interact with our database by accepting a simple URI. Once engine \n exists, we could in theory use engine exclusively via functions such as \nengine.connect()  and engine.execute().\n\nSessions\nTo interact with our database in a Pythonic manner via the ORM, we'll need to\ncreate a session  from the engine we just declared. Thus our code expands:\n\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n\nengine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:', echo=True)\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\n\n\nThat's all it takes! Now just as before, we can use SQLAlchemy's ORM and\nbuilt-in functions to make simple interacts:\n\nnew_user = User(name='todd', fullname='Todd Hacker', password='toddspassword')\nsession.add(new_user)\n\n\nTakeaway Goodies\nIt's worth mentioning that SQLAlchemy works with nearly every type of database,\nand does so by leveraging the base Python library for the respective type of\ndatabase. For example, it probably seems to the outsider that we've spent some\ntime shitting on Psycopg2. On the contrary, when SQLAlchemy connects to a\nPostgres database, it is using the Psycopg2 library under the hood to manage the\nboilerplate for us. The same goes for every other type of relational database\n[https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html]  along with their\nstandard libraries.\n\nThere are plenty of more reasons [https://www.sqlalchemy.org/features.html]  why\nSQLAlchemy is beneficial to the point where it is arguably critical to data\nanalysis workflows. The critical point to be made here is that leaving\nSQLAlchemy out of any data workflow only hurts the person writing the code, or\nmore importantly, all those who come after.","html":"<p>Something we've taken for granted thus far on Hackers and Slackers is a library most data professionals have accepted as an undisputed standard: <strong><a href=\"https://www.sqlalchemy.org/\">SQLAlchemy</a></strong>.</p><p>In the past, we've covered database connection management and querying using libraries such as <a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/using-pymysql/\"><strong>PyMySQL</strong></a> and <strong><a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/psycopg2-postgres-python-the-old-fashioned-way/\">Psycopg2</a></strong>, both of which do an excellent job of interacting with databases just as we'd expect them to.
