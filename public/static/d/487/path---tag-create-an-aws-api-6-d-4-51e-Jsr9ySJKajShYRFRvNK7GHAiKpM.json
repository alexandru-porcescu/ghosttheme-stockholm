Now that we're all feeling a bit more\ncomfortable, it may be time to let everybody in on the world's worst-kept\nsecret: Almost nobody builds architecture by interacting with the AWS UI\ndirectly. There are plenty examples of how this is done, with the main example\nbeing HashiCorp:  an entire business model based around the premise that AWS has\na shitty UI, to the point where it's easier to write code to make things which\nwill host your code. What a world.\n\nIn the case of creating Python Lambda functions, the \"official\" (aka: manual)\nworkflow of deploying your code to AWS is something horrible like this:\n\n * You start a project locally and begin development.\n * You opt to use virtualenv, because you're well aware that you're going to\n   need the source for any packages you use available.\n * When you're ready to 'deploy' to AWS, you copy all your dependencies from \n   /site-packages  and move them into your root directory, temporarily creating\n   an abomination of a project structure.\n * With your project fully bloated and confused, you cherry pick the files\n   needed to zip into an archive.\n * Finally, you upload your code via zip either to Lambda directory or to S3,\n   only to run your code, realize its broken, and need to start all over.\n\nThere Must be a Better Way\nIndeed there is, and surprisingly enough the solution is 100% Python (sorry\nHashiCorp, we'll talk another time). This \"better way\" is my personal method of\nleveraging the following:\n\n * The official AWS CLI\n   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html].\n * Pipenv [https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/]  as an environment manager.\n * Python's python-lambda [https://github.com/nficano/python-lambda]  package:\n   the magic behind it all.\n\nObligatory \"Installing the CLI\" Recap\nFirst off, make sure you're using a compatible version of Python on your system,\nas AWS is still stuck on version 3.6. Look, we can't all be Google Cloud (and by\nthe way, Python 2.7 doesn't count as compatible - let it die before your career\ndoes).\n\n$ pip3 install awscli --upgrade --user\n\n\nIf you're working off an EC2 instance, it has come to my attention pip3 does not\ncome preinstalled. Remember to run: * $ apt update\n * $ apt upgrade\n * $ apt install python3-pip\n\nYou may be prompted to run apt install awscli  as well.Awesome, now that we have\nthe CLI installed on the real  version of Python, we need to store your\ncredentials. Your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key can be found in your IAM\npolicy manager.\n\n$ aws configure\nAWS Access Key ID [None]: YOURKEY76458454535\nAWS Secret Access Key [None]: SECRETKEY*^R(*$76458397045609365493\nDefault region name [None]:\nDefault output format [None]:\n\nOn both Linux and OSX, this should generate files found under cd ~/.aws  which\nwill be referenced by default whenever you use an AWS service moving forward.\n\nSet Up Your Environment\nAs mentioned, we'll use pipenv  for easy environment management. We'll create an\nenvironment using Lambda's preferred Python version:\n\n$ pip3 install pipenv\n$ pipenv shell --python 3.6\n\nCreating a virtualenv for this project…\nPipfile: /home/example/Pipfile\nUsing /usr/bin/python3 (3.6.6) to create virtualenv…\n⠇Already using interpreter /usr/bin/python3\nUsing base prefix '/usr'\nNew python executable in /root/.local/share/virtualenvs/example-RnlD17kd/bin/python3\nAlso creating executable in /root/.local/share/virtualenvs/example-RnlD17kd/bin/python\nInstalling setuptools, pip, wheel...done.\n\n\nSomething you should be aware of at the time of writing: Pip's latest version,\n18.1, is actually a breaking change  for Pipenv. Thus, the first thing we should\ndo is force usage of pip 18.0 (is there even a fix for this yet?). This is\nsolved by typing pip3 install pip==18.0  with the Pipenv shell activated. Now\nlet's get to the easy part.\n\npython-lambda: The Savior of AWS\nSo far we've made our lives easier in two ways: we're keeping our AWS\ncredentials safe and far away from ourselves, and we have what is by far the\nsuperior Python package management solution. But this is all foreplay leading up\nto python-lambda:\n\n$ pip3 install python-lambda\n\n\nThis library alone is about to do you the following favors:\n\n * Initiate your Lambda project structure for you.\n * Isolate Lambda configuration to a  config.yaml  file, covering everything\n   from the name of your entry point, handler function, and even\n   program-specific variables.\n * Allow you to run tests locally, where a test.json  file simulates a request\n   being made to your function locally.\n * Build a production-ready zip file with all dependencies completely separated \n   from your beautiful file structure.\n * The ability to deploy directly  to S3 or Lambda with said zip file from\n   command-line.\n\nCheck out the commands for yourself:\n\nCommands:\n  build      Bundles package for deployment.\n  cleanup    Delete old versions of your functions\n  deploy     Register and deploy your code to lambda.\n  deploy-s3  Deploy your lambda via S3.\n  init       Create a new function for Lambda.\n  invoke     Run a local test of your function.\n  upload     Upload your lambda to S3.\n\n\nInitiate your project\nRunning lambda init  will generate the following file structure:\n\n.\n├── Pipfile\n├── config.yaml\n├── event.json\n└── service.py\n\n\nChecking out the entry point: service.py\npython-lambda starts you off with a basic handler as an example of a working\nproject. Feel free to rename service.py  and its handler function to whatever\nyou please, as we can configure that in a bit.\n\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\ndef handler(event, context):\n    # Your code goes here!\n    e = event.get('e')\n    pi = event.get('pi')\n    return e + pi\n\n\nEasy configuration via configure.yaml\nThe base config generated by lambda init  looks like this:\n\nregion: us-east-1\n\nfunction_name: my_lambda_function\nhandler: service.handler\ndescription: My first lambda function\nruntime: python3.6\n# role: lambda_basic_execution\n\n# S3 upload requires appropriate role with s3:PutObject permission\n# (ex. basic_s3_upload), a destination bucket, and the key prefix\n# bucket_name: 'example-bucket'\n# s3_key_prefix: 'path/to/file/'\n\n# if access key and secret are left blank, boto will use the credentials\n# defined in the [default] section of ~/.aws/credentials.\naws_access_key_id:\naws_secret_access_key:\n\n# dist_directory: dist\n# timeout: 15\n# memory_size: 512\n# concurrency: 500\n#\n\n# Experimental Environment variables\nenvironment_variables:\n    env_1: foo\n    env_2: baz\n\n# If `tags` is uncommented then tags will be set at creation or update\n# time.  During an update all other tags will be removed except the tags\n# listed here.\n#tags:\n#    tag_1: foo\n#    tag_2: bar\n\n\nLook familiar? These are all the properties you would normally have to set up\nvia the UI. As an added bonus, you can store values (such as S3 bucket names for\nboto3) in this file as well. That's dope.\n\nSetting up event.json\nThe default event.json  is about as simplistic as you can get, and naturally not\nvery helpful at first (it isn't meant to be). These are the contents:\n\n{\n  \"pi\": 3.14,\n  \"e\": 2.718\n}\n\n\nWe can replace this a real test JSON which we can grab from Lambda itself.\nHere's an example of a Cloudwatch event we can use instead:\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"cdc73f9d-aea9-11e3-9d5a-835b769c0d9c\",\n  \"detail-type\": \"Scheduled Event\",\n  \"source\": \"aws.events\",\n  \"account\": \"{{account-id}}\",\n  \"time\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"region\": \"us-east-1\",\n  \"resources\": [\n    \"arn:aws:events:us-east-1:123456789012:rule/ExampleRule\"\n  ],\n  \"pi\": 3.14,\n  \"e\": 2.718\n  \"detail\": {}\n}\n\n\nRemember that event.json  is what is being passed to our handler as the event \nparameter. Thus, now we can run our Lambda function locally  to see if it works:\n\n$ lambda invoke\n5.8580000000000005\n\n\nPretty cool if you ask me.\n\nDeploy it, Ship it, Roll Credits\nAfter you express your coding genius, remember to output pip freeze >\nrequirements.txt. python-lambda  will use this as a reference for which packages\nneed to be included. This is neat because we can use Pipenv and the benefits of\nthe workflow it provides while still easily outputting what we need to deploy. \n\nBecause we already specified which Lambda we're going to deploy to in \nconfig.yaml, we can deploy to that Lambda immediately. lambda deploy  will use\nthe zip upload method, whereas lambda deploy-s3  will store your source on S3.\n\nIf you'd like to deploy the function yourself, run with lambda build  which will\nzip your source code plus dependencies  neatly into a /dist  directory. Suddenly\nwe never have to compromise our project structure, and now we can easily source\ncontrol our Lambdas by .gitignoring our build folders while hanging on to our\nPipfiles.\n\nHere's to hoping you never need to deploy Lambdas using any other method ever\nagain.

We've also briefly covered\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/building-an-api-using-aws/]  the general concept\nbehind what Lambda functions. In case you've already forgotten, Lambdas are\nbasically just chunks of code in the cloud; think of them as tiny virtual\nservers, which have already been configured (and locked down) to serve one\nspecific purpose. Because that's literally what it is.\n\nThe data being stored in RDS is ultimately what we're targeting, and Lambdas \nserve as the in-between logic to serve up, modify, or add to the proper data.\nThe only piece missing from the picture is API Gateway. \n\nAs the name suggests, API Gateway  is the, uh, gateway  that users or systems\ninteract with to obtain what they're seeking. It is (hopefully) the only part of\nthis VPC structure an external user can interact with:\n\nSimple API to interact with RDS.Serving as a \"gateway\" is obviously what all\nAPIs so, but the term is also true in the sense that API Gateway  is completely\nconfigured via UI, thus engineers of any programming background can safely\nmodify endpoints, methods,  CORs  configurations, or any of the high-level API\nstructure without being locked into a programming language. API Gateway  is\ntherefore very much an enterprise-geared product: it lends itself to large teams\nand scaling. That said, if it were to be compared to building an API via a\nframework designed to do such things (such as Express or Flask) the experience\nis undoubtedly more clunky. The trade-off being made for speed is immediate\nvisibility, assurance, and a higher chance for collaboration.\n\nThe Challenge of Building a \"Well-Designed\" API\nGood APIs are premeditated. A complex API might accept multiple methods per\nendpoint, allow advanced filtering of results, or handle advanced\nAuthentication. Neither of us have the time to attempt covering all of those\nthings in detail, but I will  leave you with the knowledge that all these\nfeatures are very much possible.\n\nThe API Gateway  interface is where you'd get started. Let's blow through the\nworld's most inappropriately fast explanation of building APIs ever ,and check\nout the UI:\n\nIt ain't pretty, but it works. * Your APIs are listed on the left. You can create more than one, if you're\n   some sort of sadist.\n * The Resources pane is the full structure of your API. At the highest level,\n   'resources' refers to Endpoints,  which are the URLs your API will ultimately\n   expose.\n * Every Endpoint  can contain whichever Methods  you choose to associate with\n   them (GET, POST, PUT, etc). Even if they belong to the same endpoint, a POST\n   method could contain entirely unrelated logic from a PUT method: its your\n   responsibility to make sure your API design makes sense.\n * Finally, each Method has their expected Request and Response  structures\n   defined individually, which what the horribly designed box diagram is\n   attempting to explain on the right. The box on the left labeled CLIENT refers\n   to the requester, where the box on the right represents the triggered action.\n\nThis UI is your bread and butter. I hope you're strapped in, because walking\nthrough this interface is going to be hella boring for all of us.\n\nCreating a Method Request\nThe first step to creating an endpoint (let's say a GET endpoint) is to set the\nexpectation for what the user will send to us:\n\nAwe yea, authorization. 1. Authorization  allows you to restrict users from using your API unless they\n    follow your IAM policy.\n 2. Request Validator  lets you chose if you'd like this validation to happen\n    via the body, query string parameters, headers, or all of the above.\n 3. API Keys  are useful if you're creating an API to sell commercially or\n    enforce limited access. If your business model revolves around selling an\n    API, you can realistically do this.\n 4. Query String Parameters  are... actually forget it, you know this by now.\n 5. See above.\n 6. If preferred, the Request Body can be assigned a model,  which is\n    essentially a JSON schema. If a request is made to your endpoint which does\n    not match the request body model, it is a malformed request. We'll cover \n    models  in the advanced course, once somebody actually starts paying me to\n    write this stuff.\n\nMethod Execution: AKA \"What do we do with this?\"\nSet the game plan. 1. Integration Type  specifies which AWS service will be accepting or affected\n    by this request. The vast majority of the time, this will be Lambda. If\n    you're wondering why other AWS Services aren't present, this has been made\n    intentional over time as just about any AWS service you can interact with\n    will still need logic to do anything useful: you can't just shove a JSON\n    object in a database's face and expect to get results. Unless you're using\n    MongoDB or something.\n 2. Lambda Proxies  are generally a bad idea. They auto-format your Lambda's \n    request  and response  body to follow a very  specific structure, which is\n    presumably intended to help speed up or standardize development.

We've also <a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/building-an-api-using-aws/\">briefly covered</a> the general concept behind what <strong>Lambda functions</strong>. In case you've already forgotten, Lambdas are basically just chunks of code in the cloud; think of them as tiny virtual servers, which have already been configured (and locked down) to serve one specific purpose. Because that's literally what it is.</p><p>The data being stored in <strong>RDS </strong>is ultimately what we're targeting, and <strong>Lambdas</strong> serve as the in-between logic to serve up, modify, or add to the proper data. The only piece missing from the picture is <strong>API Gateway</strong>. </p><p>As the name suggests, <strong>API Gateway</strong> is the, uh, <em>gateway</em> that users or systems interact with to obtain what they're seeking. It is (hopefully) the only part of this VPC structure an external user can interact with:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-2.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/apigateway_o-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Simple API to interact with RDS.</figcaption></figure><p>Serving as a \"gateway\" is obviously what all APIs so, but the term is also true in the sense that <strong>API Gateway</strong> is completely configured via UI, thus engineers of any programming background can safely modify <em>endpoints</em>, <em>methods,</em> <em>CORs</em> configurations, or any of the high-level API structure without being locked into a programming language. <strong>API Gateway</strong> is therefore very much an enterprise-geared product: it lends itself to large teams and scaling. That said, if it were to be compared to building an API via a framework designed to do such things (such as Express or Flask) the experience is undoubtedly more clunky. The trade-off being made for speed is immediate visibility, assurance, and a higher chance for collaboration.</p><h2 id=\"the-challenge-of-building-a-well-designed-api\">The Challenge of Building a \"Well-Designed\" API</h2><p>Good APIs are premeditated. A complex API might accept multiple methods per endpoint, allow advanced filtering of results, or handle advanced Authentication. Neither of us have the time to attempt covering all of those things in detail, but I <em>will</em> leave you with the knowledge that all these features are very much possible.  </p><p>The <strong>API Gateway</strong> interface is where you'd get started. Let's blow through the world's most inappropriately fast explanation of building APIs ever ,and check out the UI:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-5.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/apigateway_overview3.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>It ain't pretty, but it works.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Your <strong>APIs </strong>are listed on the left. You can create more than one, if you're some sort of sadist.</li><li>The <strong>Resources </strong>pane is the full structure of your API. At the highest level, 'resources' refers to <strong>Endpoints,</strong> which are the URLs your API will ultimately expose.</li><li>Every <strong>Endpoint</strong> can contain whichever <strong>Methods</strong> you choose to associate with them (GET, POST, PUT, etc). Even if they belong to the same endpoint, a POST method could contain entirely unrelated logic from a PUT method: its your responsibility to make sure your API design makes sense.</li><li>Finally, each <strong>Method </strong>has their expected <strong>Request </strong>and <strong>Response</strong> structures defined individually, which what the horribly designed box diagram is attempting to explain on the right. The box on the left labeled CLIENT refers to the requester, where the box on the right represents the triggered action.</li></ul><p>This UI is your bread and butter. I hope you're strapped in, because walking through this interface is going to be hella boring for all of us.</p><h3 id=\"creating-a-method-request\">Creating a Method Request</h3><p>The first step to creating an endpoint (let's say a GET endpoint) is to set the expectation for what the user will send to us:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/methodrequest_o.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Awe yea, authorization.</figcaption></figure><ol><li><strong>Authorization</strong> allows you to restrict users from using your API unless they follow your IAM policy.</li><li><strong>Request Validator</strong> lets you chose if you'd like this validation to happen via the body, query string parameters, headers, or all of the above.</li><li><strong>API Keys</strong> are useful if you're creating an API to sell commercially or enforce limited access. If your business model revolves around selling an API, you can realistically do this.</li><li><strong>Query String Parameters</strong> are... actually forget it, you know this by now.</li><li>See above.</li><li>If preferred, the <strong>Request Body </strong>can be assigned a <strong>model,</strong> which is essentially a JSON schema. If a request is made to your endpoint which does not match the request body model, it is a malformed request. We'll cover <strong>models</strong> in the advanced course, once somebody actually starts paying me to write this stuff.</li></ol><h3 id=\"method-execution-aka-what-do-we-do-with-this\">Method Execution: AKA \"What do we do with this?\"</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/methodexecution_o.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Set the game plan.</figcaption></figure><ol><li><strong>Integration Type</strong> specifies which AWS service will be accepting or affected by this request. The vast majority of the time, this will be Lambda. If you're wondering why other AWS Services aren't present, this has been made intentional over time as just about any AWS service you can interact with will still need logic to do anything useful: you can't just shove a JSON object in a database's face and expect to get results. Unless you're using MongoDB or something.</li><li><strong>Lambda Proxies</strong> are generally a bad idea. They auto-format your Lambda's <em>request</em> and <em>response</em> body to follow a very  specific structure, which is presumably intended to help speed up or standardize development.

We're going to make our way through this slowly, which is probably a good\nidea even if you've done this before. There are so many pitfalls and nuances in\nAWS's architecture that I'm not even sure I fully understand what's happening,\neven when everything works.\n\nQuick Overview\nHere are the services we'll be using to hook this baby up:\n\n *   RDS:  Amazon's cloud-hosted relational databases. These databases come\n   preconfigured with an endpoint, which can be made accessible to other AWS\n   services or even to external manipulation. \n *   Lambda:  Snippets of code which can be invoked without setting up a web\n   server (hence: \"serverless\"). Lambda functions are intended to serve simple,\n   specific functions (such as serving as the logic for an endpoint, for\n   instance). Lambda functions play well with other AWS services: we'll be using\n   this as the glue between our API and interacting with the Database.\n *   API Gateway:  Amazon's visual editor for creating an API. API Gateway\n   allows developers to architect the structure and logic of APIs without having\n   to worry about setting up routes via code.\n *   IAM:  Amazon's headache of a user & permissions manager. IAM is needed to\n   specify exactly with AWS services have access to other services, which users\n   are permitted to interact with your API, etc. \n\nGameplan\nSo here's the deal. Our RDS  database will be where all the data we provide and\nreceive will live. Lambda  functions will be the snippets of code actually\ninteracting with information from the database; all of our queries will be done\nthrough Lambda. API Gateway  will control the \"design\" of the API, as in the\nstructure of endpoints, their respective methods, and how all these should\ninteract with Lambda.\n\nIt sounds simple enough, but the devil is in the details. And trust me, there\nare a lot of details.\n\nSetting the Correct Role Permissions\nUsually, I'd say we should jump into the fun stuff and deal with the details\nwhen we get to them. I won't let you steer down that road with AWS... let's\navoid smashing our heads on keyboards where possible and kick things off slow.\n\nIf you were to attempt to create a Lambda function off the bat, the first prompt\nto appear would demand a \"role\" to be specified. Roles are one of the types of\npermission packages (?) we mentioned earlier. Roles limit exactly which services\nyour Lambda function can interact with off the bat. Start with the wrong role,\nand you won't be able to do much of anything.\n\nHead over the IAM console\n[https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/home]  to set up an\nappropriate role:\n\nWhat a God-awful way to handle permissions.Let's pause for a moment to take this\nall in. You'll see we have users, groups, roles, policies and a whole bunch of\nother garbage. Policies can be attached to roles. Policies can also be attached\nto users, and also attached to groups. Users can be in groups. Wait, so what if\na user has a bunch of policies, but then joins a group with a bunch of policies?\nWhat even is a \"policy\"? These are the real questions. The short answer is none\nof it makes sense; it's just extra job security for those who make it work.\n\nClick on \"Roles\" in the sidebar. Create a role. Select \"Lambda\" and click next.\n\nThis interface only seems to get worse.Ok cool. The role  we're creating is basically just going to be a collection of\npermissions we can attached directly to the role. Go ahead and attach these:\n\n * AmazonVPCFullAccess\n * AmazonAPIGatewayInvokeFullAccess\n * AmazonRDSFullAccess\n * AWSLambdaFullAccess\n * CloudWatchLogsFullAccess\n\nSave the role, and remember what you name it. You'll need it.\n\nGetting Started with Lambda Functions\nGo back to the Lambda console. It's game time. We're going to create a function\nfrom scratch (sadly, I haven't found any of the blueprints to be very useful\njust yet).\n\nIgnore Amazon's silly Blueprints.Under “runtime”, you’ll need to pick which\nprogramming language we’ll be writing our function in. I’m doing Python 3\nbecause I don’t mess with semicolons, ya dig. Most people seem to stick with\nNode, which makes sense: Node is much faster at runtime, especially when you\nconsider that AWS runs Node natively. The choice is your preference.\n\nAha, see the “Role” dropdown? This is what I warned you about. Select the role\nyou just created earlier from existing roles.\n\nLambda Function Editor\nWelcome to Lambda's web UIBehold, the Lambda visual editor. That tree you're\nseeing is a representation of the integration this function will handle. The\ncurrent function is the box top-middle, the trigger is on the left, and the list\nof potential AWS services we can touch is on the right; these were automatically\npopulated by that role I forced you to create. You're welcome.\n\nNOTE:  The entire interface below this section depends on which service you've\nclicked in the tree. It's not the most intuitive at first. I have my Lambda\nfunction selected, so that's the interface I can interact with below.\n\nInline Code Editor\nWe can create Lambdas directly in the browser, or by uploading souce via zip\nfile.Real quick, we need to go over what each field here does. The dropdown\ncurrently set to \"edit code inline\" can be expanded, which gives you the option\nto upload a zip file of source code. THIS WILL DELETE ALL PREEXISTING WORK. \nThey don't tell you that, hah. Ha hah. I recommend doing everything offline to\nbe uploaded later - this needs to be done with python packages anyway.\n\nHandler  specifies which function should be called upon initialization.\n\"lambda_function\" is referring to the function, so \"handler\" here specifies that\nthe function handler within lambda_function.py  is what will get called upon\nexecution.\n\nOur Lambda’s VPC Settings\nScroll down until you hit this pretty little gem:\n\nAWS is filled with complicated network concepts, and zero attempts to explain\nthem.We need to specify the VPC this function will interact with. If you created\nan RDS already, go ahead select the VPC you created. Add a bunch of subnets\n(whichever ones). Finally, select a security group. Remember that the\npermissions of this group determine whether or not your VPC is allowed to speak\nto this function. If you're struggling with this, check out the AWS MySQL post\nagain. I'm not going to link it twice in one post, sorry. I have self-respect\nyou know.\n\nThat's Enough For Now\nThere's a lot to take in when playing around in AWS. The combination of\ngibberish terminology and horrible documentation doesn't exactly make for solid\nuser experience. If you're new to AWS and any of this seems frustrating, know\nit's supposed to be. Amazon owns you, and they hate you. Kind of like God.\n\nI'd suggest messing around the interface, and maybe even check out API Gateway a\nbit to get a feel for how that stuff looks. They set you up with a cute demo to\nmake you think it's going to be easy, so maybe you'll enjoy that. Next time,\nwe're going to crank out some Lambdas.","html":"<p>There comes a surreal moment in nearly every profession in which perspective violently forces itself into our self-awareness.
