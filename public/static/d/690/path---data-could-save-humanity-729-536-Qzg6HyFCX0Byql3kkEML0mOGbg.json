Looking\nback, I've spent that time almost exclusively in the niche of data-driven\nproducts and engineering. While it seems obvious now, I realized in the 2000s\nthat you could generally create two types of product: you could either build a\n(likely uninspired) UI for existing data, or you could build products which\nproduced new data or interpreted existing data in a new useful way. Betting on\nthe latter seemed like an obvious choice. The late 2000’s felt like building\napps for the sake of apps most of the time. Even today Product Hint is littered\nwith weather apps and rehashed tools, solving problems so insignificant that\nthey almost seem satirical.\n\nYears passed, thus our data-centric tools evolved to fit cultural mind shifts in\nbusinesses which speculated on how these tools could be used. This began to\nbuild a clear yet slowly-growing narrative about how enterprises consider data\nanalysis in their org structures. Unfortunately, I can't say that much about\nthat shift has been positive. There are a number of major problems I believe we\nneed to address:\n\n *   SaaS is created with the goal of selling the product to enterprises. While\n   humanity's understanding of data science reach unprecedented territory, we\n   choose to perfect the  sales pitch  while neglecting education on these\n   tools.\n * As an atrocity to science, individual actors commonly cherry pick information\n   to confirm conclusions for personal benefit, without checks and balances. \n * Data which contradicts knee jerk assumptions made by executives are sometimes\n   taken as personal threats or attacks.\n * Most importantly, data professionals are horribly siloed. Analysts,\n   scientists, and engineers waste far too much time drawing lines between\n   roles: I find it absolutely absurd  to unanimously agree that tool X is for\n   BI  while tool Y is for data cleanup. Considering we all know  these tools\n   are running stacks on Python, R, SQL, etc, there is no reason to succumb to\n   the limitations of proprietary software (such as Tableau). We've turned a\n   blind eye to the possibility of 'data as a service': a chance to overlap\n   responsibilities by building a better  tool to reduce friction, as opposed to\n   increase it in the interest of selling more software.\n\nWhile we might all agree that collective 'data addiction' is reaching a peak,\nmost of us barely know what we mean by that. We conceptually understand that\ndata is important, but our imaginations on how to utilize this power effectively\nleaves a lot to be desired. IBM Watson probably had profound capabilities, but\nits failure lies with the humans tasked to make this technology relevant and\nuseful for humankind.\n\nThe Analytics Honeymoon\nAs I imagine most in the Product Management professionals do, I originally\nconsidered  data analysis to come in the form of web and app analytics. This was\na one-dimensional era; consumer-facing data served the sole purpose of\noptimizing sales and ad revenue, and there were much fewer choices of\nEnterprise-level tools to fall in love with. While the cheaper tools were just\nfine, corporate America had already fallen in love with a fickle mistress known\nas Omniture. \n\nOmniture was in fact in many ways the superior product on the market. As I'm\nsure Sales reps explained in those years, Omniture allowed for a vast level of\nevent tracking customization which was otherwise rare at the time: with the\nproper logic, effort, and willingness, executives could theoretically identify\ngranular issues in their product's conversation flow: issues which came attached\nwith cold hard facts in the form of numbers.\n\nThus, a game of numbers it was: in order to receive the level of granular detail\nexecutives wanted, there came a nominal fee. Well, many fees in fact: the\nproduct out-priced competitors tenfold upfront for the license itself. Since you\njust agreed to spend that much money on proprietary software, it only makes\nsense at that point that you should then hire a certified affiliated consultant\nto implement the custom reports, and then of course pay the lifelong upkeep that\ncomes with tracking events in ever-changing software. Despite all of these\ncosts, companies consistently moved forward with the choice under the\nrealization that the money saved from this data could far outweigh the cost.\n\nSo what happened when we actually collected all that data?\n\nIf You Could Get That Analytics Report, That Would be Great.\nEnterprises and data analysis were made for each other... but in a way that most\nclosely resembles a cliché romcom starring Julia Roberts. This romance follows\nthe beat of a metronome: while executives begin to grasp the impact of\ndata-based decisions, the commitment to actually acknowledge the abundance of\nthis information has its own lifespan. A/B testing, conversation funnels,\nsegmentation, etc: while the foreplay of implementing these buzzwords rolls on\nfor a number of weeks, it gives powerful figures time to reflect on one thing in\nparticular: they've owed their success to a lack of quantifiable accountability,\nand numbers are right around the corner. While this might not be a conscious\nact, it is an entirely real phenomenon.\n\nI've traditionally been a product manager, yet during that period of my career,\nI've found myself nominated to be Gatekeeper of Digital and Financial Data...\nfor whatever reason (it's worth reiterating that I am not nor ever have been an\nanalyst). The phenomenon followed a pattern. Given their expectations,\nexecutives reach their nerves end when the budget they allocated for\nenterprise-level sotftware is still under configuration, and has produced no\nresults. There's a reason why patience is a virtue isn't a phrase you see in\nmany sales pitches: we want what we're being sold, and we want it now. \n\nThats where I'd typically come in. As a product manager, analytics is a valuable\nweapon, so unspeakable amounts of unsolicited data thrown into my lap  seemed\nlike ammunition for change. When a company's problems are become as large as\nthey are obvious, some numerical correlations are nearly common sense..\n\nCue the dashboards, custom reports, event tracking, you name it. Often times\nexecutives would set aside a weekly cadence to review the expensive conclusions\nour software could finally produce. The weekly email newsletters I would produce\nwould be met with a euphoric chain of satisfied stakeholders, time and time\nagain. Finally it seemed, the conclusions were clear and our problems were\nquantifiable. And yet, nothing seemed to change.\n\nHuman Insecurities Versus World Problems\nAs a data enthusiast, I did what we all would've done: I placed analytics\ntracking on our analytics reports themselves. \"Great stuff, groundbreaking work\nhere\" said one CEO, who I'd seen had not bothered to click the link provided. At\na certain point, I began attaching empty Excel spreadsheets and posting dead\nlinks as the content of our beloved reports. Those too were 'groundbreaking',\napparently.\n\nThis is far from an isolated phenomenon in technology. Meeting after meeting,\nclient after client, I took front-row seats to blatant dismissal of numerical\nevidence in favor of  ego-driven decisions. Test A would prove to yield 30%\nhigher conversion rates than Test B, but Test B would prevail thanks to the\nsubjective emotional opinions of talking heads. In retrospect, I can see now how\na grown adult with a household would find the sudden introduction of facts\nthreatening. We have have imposter syndrome, and the twenty-something year old\nanalyst attempting to improve a company will almost always lose to an adult\nprotecting a family.\n\nConsider a recent example uncovered by mistake. While auditing usage for a\nwidely-know project management tool, something seemed off about our volume of\nusage with a product costing us unspeakable dollars. Our department had mostly\nbeen tasked  to upkeep this 'critical' internal system at all costs. As it turns\nout, over 80% of all activity had been out own internal upkeep. That's millions\nof dollars invested in something never used over the course of several years,\nall for the purpose of upholding a guise of value-add.\n\nBI, Data Science, and the Choice to Make That Distinction\nI've spent the last several months working deep under the hood attempting to\ndismantle our undisputed BI overlords over at Tableau. Fair warning: I'm about\nto rip in to a Tableau tangent here, but I promise there's a point.\n\nI was introduced to Tableau as a tool to fill a niche: quick analysis and\none-off extracts on tight timelines. The type of timelines where digging into\nPandas and potentially entering a .bash_profile hell with Anaconda simply wasn’t\nan option. I was pleased with its ability to serve this purpose- such that it\nsparked a spontaneous 1 thousand purchase for a personal license. Tableau\nDesktop, Tableau Prep, and Tableau server; a decision I’ll likely regret for the\nrest of my life.\n\nFrom my naïve perspective it seemed logical that Tableau could help assist in\nthe data cleanup and automation I had been handling in scripts previously. This\ncould not be more incorrect. Even with full access to my own Tableau instance,\nit is clear that Tableau has one motive only: to show you your data, and ensure\nyou don't take it elsewhere. Consider this:\n\nCheck out the worksheets and and dashboards you've published to Server.\nConsidering these are equivalent to simple database views, you'd expect the API\ncalls to be exposed in your dev tools... why not? They aren't.\n\nTableau runs on a Postgres database on your personal server. However, no mention\nof \"postgres\" or anything of the sort is searchable to a useful degree. There is\na highly protected Tableau superadmin account which has controls to all tables\nand views in this server, but most research will point users to unlock the\n\"readonly\" user which is essentially a red herring account, or perhaps useful if\nyou're spying on your employee's actions.\n\nAnd then we have the Tableau server API. Ah, what a gift it would be to query\nthose views we created, running on scheduled extracts, so that we might build\nsomething from this information. As it turns out, Tableau's REST API does little\nmore than reveal meta data about files you already knew about. Just in case you\nwere wondering the date it was created, for some weird useless reason.\n\nI'm not just picking on Tableau here (although I'll continue my series about\nhacking them soon enough). This has exposed a massive dichotomy in the way we\nsee and treat data as a profession, or rather, a series of professions. between\nthose who look at data, and those who manipulate, iterate one, and create things\nwith Data. Nobody has ever expressed this realization to me, and many of you\nlikely still don't see what the big deal is. That, to me, is the big deal.\n\nData should be a passion to those looking to improve humanity, without a doubt.\nIf we know personalities are wining the battles against numbers, and feel numb\nto the fact that our proprietary tools prevent us from using data effectively,\nthere's something to be said about the complacency of humanity as we commit to\nconsumption over production. \n\nCompany attitudes towards data are one thing, but individuals are an entirely\ndifferent story. That's a long-winded post for another time.","html":"<p>A decade has passed since I stumbled into technical product development.
