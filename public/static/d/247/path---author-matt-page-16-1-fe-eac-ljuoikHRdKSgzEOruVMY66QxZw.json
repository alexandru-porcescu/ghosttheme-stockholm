Pandas by itself is pretty well-optimized, but it's designed\nto only work on one core.  Dask, on the other hand, lets you split the work\nbetween different cores - both on a single machine, or on a distributed system.\n It doesn't implement every single thing you can do with Pandas, though, so only\nuse it when you have to.\n\n  I probably should have titled this post \"Parallel Pandas\", but hey, too late\nnow - plus \"Lazy Pandas\" more easily lends itself to a nice visual metaphor.\n Anyway, Laziness is  part of the process.  Because Dask is lazy by default\n(much like your humble narrator), we can define our fileout loading it, like so:\n\nimport dask.dataframe as dd\n\ndf = dd.read_csv(\"giantThing.csv\")\n\n\nPandas was taking a long time to parse the file.  What's more is that this file\nhad a few quirks - I'd figured out that it needed a special text encoding, and I\nwasn't sure if there was other weirdness going on.  Was my computer just taking\na long time to nom the file, or was I going to wait there for a few minutes to\nfind an error message?  It's a catch-22 - I needed to figure out how to cut the\nfile down to size, but in order to do that I would have needed to be able to\nload it into memory.  Dask to the rescue!\n\nThis file wasn't terribly well-documented - I had an inkling as to what column\nwould tell me which rows I wanted, but I wasn't sure.  So, first thing I did was\ncheck out the first few rows.  Remember, in order to see these first 5 rows in\nPandas, I'd have to load the whole thing into memory (which might or might not\neven work!).\n\ndf.head()\n\nWith that, I was able to do a simple spot-check and see if there were any weird\ncolumns that might get in the way of parsing.  Furthermore, I confirmed that the\nID columns I was looking at contained something vaguely like what I was looking\nfor.  Even MORE interestingly, I found that it was formatted slightly\nirregularly.  Even more use for laziness!  Let's load just that one column into\nmemory (you could do this with a loop, sure - but selecting a single column is a\nlot clumsier)\n\ndf[\"ORG_NAME\"].compute()\n\nNote the .compute()  method at the end.  That's necessary because of the Lazy\nEvaluation - just calling a column name doesn't make Dask think you necessarily\nwant the thing now.  I'm not sure why I didn't have to call it with df.head(),\nthough (that's the Hackers & Slackers Codeblogging vérité style!).\n\nSo, now that I've seen the formatting, I found out that I'm going to have to\nfilter it with a call of a str.contains()  method instead of an exact value.\n Let's poke around a teensy bit more.\n\norgDF = df[\"ORG_NAME\"]\norgFiltered = corp[corp.str.contains(\"baseName\", na=False)].compute().shape\n\n\nTurns out it was only about 800 rows!So, let's filter that and make a regular\nPandas Dataframe (and probably a new CSV for later!)\n\ndf = dd.read_csv(\"giantThing.csv\")\n\norgFiltered = df[df[\"ORG_NAME\"].str.contains(\"baseName\", na=False)].compute()\n\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame(orgFiltered)\ndf2.to_csv(\"filteredThing.csv\")\n\n\nNote that I actually could have done this with base Pandas, through use of the\niterator flag.  However, I didn't realize that it's only wind up being so few\nrows.  It also would have been slower - and the speed difference makes a huge\ndifference in terms of how fluidly you can explore.\n\nFor instance, the na=False  flag was something I discovered would be needed\nbecause of a quirk in the file - again, this sort of thing becomes a lot easier\ndo diagnose when you can iterate quickly, and you know you're not going to just\ntimeout from running out of memory.\n\nFor comparison's sake, here's the code for filtering on the fly and loading into\nPandas:\n\niter_csv = pd.read_csv(\"giantThing.csv\",\n                iterator=True, \n                       chunksize=1000)\n\ndf = pd.concat([chunk[chunk[\"ORG_NAME\"].str.contains(\"baseName\", na=False)] \n                for chunk in iter_csv])\n\n\nOn my computer, that took a little over 3 minutes.  While the Dask code took\nabout a minute.","html":"<p>Ah, laziness.  You love it, I love it, everyone agrees it's just better.</p><p>Flesh-and-blood are famously lazy.  Pandas the package, however, uses Eager Evaluation.  What's Eager Evaluation, you ask?
