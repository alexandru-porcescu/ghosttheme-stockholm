Iterating through DB output by hand?\nRemembering which function is the actual one that matches the Python data\nstructure you're gonna be using?\n\nThere has to be a better way!\n\nThere totally is.\n\nOne of Pandas' most useful abilities is easy I/O. Whether it's a CSV, JSON, an\nExcel file, or a database - Pandas gets you what you want painlessly. In\nfact,I'd say that even if you don't have the spare bandwidth at the moment to\nrewire your brain to learn all the wonderful ways Pandas lets you manipulate\ndata (array-based programming generally isn't the first paradigm people learn),\nthen it's STILL worth using just for the I/O. Grab your data with one of its\ndelicious one-liners, and once it's in a Dataframe there's have a method to\nconvert it to practically any combination of native Python data structures that\nyou want (lists of lists? Lists of dictionaries? Lots of other stuff?  You've\ngot it!).\n\nHere we'll be looking at interacting with a database with Pandas, because that's\nwhat I was finishing up when I saw Todd texted me that a lot of the people who\nwind up on the site are searching for Pandas stuff.\n\nSo, for our purposes, let's say you're doing Python stuff with a MySQL database.\nI'm also assuming you're using Linux (including via Windows Subsystem for Linux,\nwhich is what I use in order to have Ubuntu on my Windows laptop), because I've\nnever done this with Windows.\n\nAnnoyingly, there's more than one potential connector - I generally use PyMySQL,\nfor no particular reason. Installing this involves an extra step - telling pip\nor Conda to install it won't do the whole thing. Annoying, but them's the\nbreaks.\n\nsudo apt-get install python3-pymysql -y\n\n\nShould get you there. I remember fussing with this every time I have to do it on\na new machine.\n\nYou also have to install a mysql-connector, for reasons I won't pretend to\nunderstand.\n\nconda install mysql-connector-python -y\n\n\nI've never actually done this with pip, but I assume it'd be\n\npip install mysql-connector\n\n\nIf that doesn't work, try\n\npip install --allow-external mysql-connector-python mysql-connector-python\n\n\nWE'RE ALMOST DONE INSTALLING THINGS!\nLast, but not least, is a lovely little thing called SQLAlchemy. Remember when I\nsaid I didn't actually know anything about PyMySQL and its relative advantages\nand disadvantages to other MySQL connectors for Python? Part of the reason for\nthat is that SQLAlchemy, as the name implies, allows you to MAGICALLY wrap\nPython SQL connectors at a higher level of abstraction and not have to deal with\nthe particulars. So, grab a little chunk of Philosopher's Stone, and - oh, it's\nactually a default Anaconda package. BUT, if you're in a fresh environment (or\nnot using Conda)...\n\n(Always remember the little -y   at the end. That ensures that you can walk away\nwhile it installs and it'll be done when you get back, instead of finishing the\nlong process of whatever's happening when you first tell it to install and then\nwaiting to start on the next long process that takes place after you hit y.)\n\nOR\n\npip install sqlalchemy   (that IS one of the nice things about pip! Doesn't need\nyou to confirm).\n\nSo, to review, before we start Pythoning...\n\n$ sudo apt-get install python3-pymysql -y\n$ conda install mysql-connector-python -y\n$ conda install -c anaconda sqlalchemy -y\n\n\nOR\n\n$ sudo apt-get install python3-pymysql -y\n$ pip install mysql-connector\n$ pip install sqlalchemy\n\n\nCool! Ready to learn about SQLAlchemy? Well, you won't - this is about Pandas!\n We're going YET ANOTHER LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION HIGHER. SQLAlchemy is just what\nPandas uses to connect to databases.\n\nAaaand one (possible) last step. If you're doing this with a locally-installed\ndb, you might have to sudo service mysql start.\n\n(Like, every time you do dev work on it. At least on my machine. Your mileage\nmay vary)\n\nOn to the Actual Python\nSo, what does all this do for us? Well, first off, it wasn't THAT much - and you\nonly have to do it once (per machine (really per environment per machine (you\nare  taking advantage of Conda envs or virtualenvs, right?))). But what it\nreally lets us skip all the implementation  details and focus on the actual\nlogic of what we're doing. That's really what both SQL and Pandas are all about-\nthey wed short, declarative  bits of code to highly optimized libraries\nunderneath the hood. Relational Database Management Systems sit on top of code\nthat's been optimized for decades, turning your short queries into highly\nefficient compiled code. Pandas takes advantage of scientific computing\nlibraries for doing matrix operations that have been around since before there\nwas an internet. Drill down deep enough in Pandas and you'll actually find\nFORTRAN code that was originally written to simulate nuclear explosions. Our\nwhole goal is to just focus on our data manipulation via SQL and Python's\nscientific computing family - and we don't want to add a bunch of additional\ncognitive load from worrying about cursors.\n\nOkay, I Lied - NOW on to the Actual Python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport pymysql\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\n\n\nFrom all the database connector stuff we installed, we actually just need ONE\nfunction - and then it's pure blissful operations on data from here on out.\ncreate_engine()  will create a connection for us, and then we'll use that as an\nargument to Pandas functions that talk to the DB. You might have to reopen it\nsometimes. Whatever.\n\nFirst, let's make a string that describes our database. Note that normally you\nshouldn't actually store this directly in your code (IT will totally be mad at\nyou), but for our purposes let's include it.\n\nThe format is:\n\ndialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database\n\n\nSo, since we're using mysql, and the PyMySQL package, we'd start with:\n\nmysql+pymysql://username:password@host:port/database\n\n\nThe rest is fairly straightforward. So, if we've got the user \"analyst\"  with\nthe password \"badsecuritykills\" with a local MySQL running on port 3306 (pretty\nsure you don't have to specify a port if it's localhost, but bear with me), and\nthe database itself is named terrible_purchases, it'd be:\n\nmysql+pymysql://analyst:badsecuritykills@localhost:3306/terrible_purchases\n\n\nAnd now let's actually make our connection!\n\ncnx = create_engine('mysql+pymysql://analyst:badsecuritykills@localhost:3306/terrible_purchases)\n\n\nDone! Now Pandas can read and write from our database.\nIf you don't wanna have to see a whole bunch of extraneous stuff, I'd also add\nthe flag echo=False  (create_engine  has a ton of useful little flags, letting\nyou do stuff like automatically strip unicode that your database might not be\nable to read).\nBehold! We can write an SQL query and then get a Pandas Dataframe with those\nexact parameters. We can rapidly prototype without worrying that the reason our\nquery isn't working is that we forgot some fussy intermediary stage. We can get\nstuff wrong and experiment!\n\nReading a table is easy as:\n\ndf = pd.io.sql.sql_query(\"SELECT * FROM cursed_items\", cnx)\n\n\nDone in one line!\n\nWriting is just as easy (with a teeeensy little asterisk, that I'll probably\ntalk about in the future). Let's say we dusted off an old CSV with more cursed\nitems that aren't in our database. After we've loaded it (and maybe done some\ncleaning)\n\nnewCursedItemsDF.to_sql(name='cursed_items', con=cnx, if_exists='append')\n\n\nThe if_exists  flag adds a ton of flexibility. You can create a whole new DB\ntable from a Dataframe, and that's actually the default behavior. For our case,\nwe appended - but there's other times when we might want to replace, for\ninstance.\n\nFinal Addendum\nSo, this is a super useful workflow for doing interactive analytics work with\nstuff that's on a database. It's also quite useful for quick-and-dirty scripts,\nor for prototyping the logic of something that'll be expanded upon later.  And,\nah, bigger stuff too - especially if there's gonna be really complex\ntransformations that. As long as the data can fit in memory (RAM), Pandas is\npretty awesome.\n\n\nThat being said, there are  times when you'd actually want to deal with the\nlevels we bypassed here. Everything has tradeoffs. One example would be that all\nthose compiled Linear Algebra libraries that Pandas sit on top of have a massive\nmemory footprint, and AWS Lambda charges you according to memory usage. I'm\npretty sure there are also use cases where this method of handling the\nlower-level nitty-gritty of database interactions (ie, by mostly not  handling\nit) will cause problems. But at that point, we're dealing with the difference\nbetween Data Science & Data Engineering.","html":"<p>Manually opening and closing cursors? Iterating through DB output by hand?

I thought I was, but it isn't until we\nneed to start a new project from scratch that we realize that we totally forgot\nthe configuration process we took last time. That's why I'm here.\n\nLet's have a quick refresher on the parts that make up Handlebars\n\n * Layouts  are the most ambiguous high-level layer; these are commonly used to\n   set underlying page metadata as well as general layout (for lack of a better\n   term).\n * Pages  are templates which equate to one type  of page. For example, the\n   'post' page on this site is unique from, say, the homepage. Because all posts\n   share elements with one another, hundreds of posts share this same template.\n * Partials  are snippets which can be shared between pages, such as navigation.\n * A Context  is content which is passed to templates and result in being the\n   page's content\n * Helpers  are the closest we get to logic in Handlebars: these allow us to\n   display or omit content based on conditionals such as if  statements. For\n   example: showing an author's avatar only if they have uploaded an image.\n\nProject Setup\nWe're going to use the Express /views  folder to contain all of our handlebars\ngoodness. Our project should look something like this:\n\nmyapp\n├── bin\n├── build\n├── routes\n├── src\n├── views\n│   ├── layouts/\n│   ├── partials/\n│   └── error.hbs\n│   └── index.hbs\n│   └── login.hbs\n│   └── etc\n└── README.md\n└── app.js\n└── package.json\n\n\nIt's important to distinguish that we've separated our views folder into three\nclassifications for layouts, partials, and pages, where pages occupy the root \n/views  directory. It's important to keep this distinction as our structure\naffects how we serve up these templates.\n\nConfigure that Ish\nInstall handlebars:\n\nnpm install handlebars --save\n\n\nCrack open your app.js  file or whatever it is you call that thing. Require\nhandlebars:\n\nvar hbs = require( 'express-handlebars');\n\n\nNext we'll configure Express to use Handlebars as the view engine, and tell\nExpress where to find these files:\n\n// view engine setup\napp.set('view engine', 'hbs');\n\napp.engine( 'hbs', hbs( {\n  extname: 'hbs',\n  defaultView: 'default',\n  layoutsDir: __dirname + '/views/pages/',\n  partialsDir: __dirname + '/views/partials/'\n}));\n\n\nExpress assumes by default that we're storing our views in the '/views' folder,\nwhich we are. We take this a step further by specifying which subfolders our \npartials  and layouts  are in above. We can save pages  directly in /views.\n\nNotice that we're also setting a default layout. We can override this in our\nroutes if needed, but setting a default layout is useful for loading pages in an\nhtml wrapper container page metadata.\n\nKicks on Route 66\nLet's create our first route in routes/index.js. We're going to load a view\ncalled home  into a layout called default:\n\nvar express = require('express');\nvar router = express.Router();\n\nrouter.get('/', function(req, res, next) {\n  res.render('home', {layout: 'default', template: 'home-template'});\n});\n\n\nThis will render views/home.hbs  into views/layouts/default.hbs, provided are\nviews are set up correctly. We also pass a custom value template  which is\nuser-defined; more on that below.\n\nBasic Usage\nLet's finally take a look at our actual Handlebars views. Here's default.hbs:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n  <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n  <title>Best Website</title>\n  <meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"True\" />\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover\" />\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/css/main.min.css\">\n</head>\n<body class=\"{{template}}\">\n  <div class=\"container\">\n\t  {{{body}}}\n  </div>\n  {{> footer}}\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\nWe have three values here: {{template}}  and {{{body}}}, and {{> footer}}.\n\n{{template}}  is a value with double brackets, thus is expecting linear data. We\npassed template  in our route: this sets the body class to equal home-template \non the chance that we'll want to apply page-specific styles or logic in the\nfuture.\n\n{{{body}}}  is rocking the triple brackets, and is reserved specifically to\nserve this purpose: loading templates into other templates.\n\nLastly we have {{> footer}}. This will load a partial named footer  from \nviews/partials/footer.hbs, provided that we create it. The difference between\nhow {{{body}}}  and {{> footer}}  are being loaded have to do with a general\nworkflow philosophy; pages are the main event and thus are loaded into layouts\nby their command. Partials can be called by pages at will whenever we please.\n\nThere's obviously a lot more to Handlebars- the fun doesn't truly begin until we\npull dynamic values from databases or wherever. We'll get there.","html":"<p>Writing HTML sucks, thus we should do everything to minimize the time we spend writing it as much as possible.  Thus, we have <a href=\"https://handlebarsjs.com/\">Handlebars</a>: a lightweight templating system for Node.

(not within scope of this document)\nat same location, we need Ansible-playbook to work so we will get Ansible for\nWindows.\n\nOn second thought, we won't install Ansible for Windows. We will just run the\nAnsible-playbook on our remote system - after we push and pull the updates from\nsource control. We can use the --check flag or dev inventory for testing.\n\nStarting the Work:\nCurrently, my client's websites exist within a docker container per website.\n\nThe plan is to have a cron job to run an ansible-playbook which will create a\nDocker Image out of each customer's Docker Container. The Docker Image will be\npushed to AWS ECS Docker Registry regularly.\n\nWe will have a loop in our Ansible scripts so the backup is individually applied\nto each item (website) in our Inventory file.\n\nCron will run the bash script to initiate the ansible-playbook run.\n\nFirst we will follow this document to allow Ansible to prepare our connectivity\nand authenticate with AWS ECS\nhttps://dedisource.com/docs/display/Public/Ansible+amazon-ecr-credential-helper+module\n\nThen, we will need to convert these steps to Ansible script actions using the\nAnsible Command module\nhttps://dedisource.com/docs/display/Public/Backup+container+to+registry\n\nLastly, when we have the Ansible Scripts working to Enable Connection to ECS\n[https://dedisource.com/docs/display/Public/Enable+Connection+to+AWS+ECS], \nPackage Docker Container to Image\n[https://dedisource.com/docs/display/Public/Package+Docker+Container+to+Image],\nTag Image and Push to AWS ECS registry\n[https://dedisource.com/docs/display/Public/Tag+Image+and+Push+to+AWS+ECS+registry]\n\nWe will Set Cron Job for Shell Script\n[https://dedisource.com/docs/display/Public/Cron+Job+for+Shell+Script]  to run\nonce per day.
