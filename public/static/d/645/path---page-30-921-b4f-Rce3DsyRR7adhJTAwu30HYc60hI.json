Namely,\nwe've chosen to spend our three-day weekends on the internet, as opposed to\noutside.\n\nI've been meaning to build a  widget for this very blog for quite some time now.\nThe vision is to embed a custom Kanban board, which would pull issues from our\nprivate JIRA instance to be publicly displayed and formatted to our liking. To\nmy knowledge, nobody has bothered to attempt building something like this yet;\nprobably for good reason. There are a few gotchas off the bat: for one, JIRA\ncloud's REST API has introduced a \"bug\" which disallows cross-domain calls.\nFine.\n\nMy frustration with propriety software has come down to this: we're going to use\ntwo highly-protected closed source behemoth products against one another. Here's\nthe plan:\n\n * Pull JIRA issues into Tableau\n * Format the data in a worksheet\n * Output our data to a MongoDB database\n * Build a Kanban widget to display these issues\n * Hack the shit out of both JIRA and Tableau to make this process automated\n\nIf this seems like a convoluted way of achieving a small goal, it absolutely is\n- the goal is just as much to become familiar with these systems as is the end\nprize. There's a lot going on here, so for part 1 let's do a dry run of getting\nour issues from JIRA to MongoDB.\n\nThe Extraction\nPulling all issues from JIRA would normally be a simple API call, but in the\nspirit of learning new things we'll try out JIRA's Tableau connector\n[https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1214641/all-in-one-tableau-connector-for-jira]\n. This essentially enables an endpoint specifically for Tableau to pull JIRA\ndata from. After installing the JIRA add-on, we'll be able to produce a URL for\nTableau to consume via the Web Data Connector source:\n\nThe connector allows us to select the data we're looking to pull from JIRA\nupfront. Keep our scope in mind: we're looking to simply display a \"card\" (think\nTrello for all you noobs out there) per issue, so we're only concerned with the\ninformation we'd need to build that. I've boiled this down to:\n\n * Key\n * Issue Type\n * Summary\n * Description\n * Status\n * Creator\n * Priority\n * Epic link\n * Epic Name\n * Epic Color\n\nThe field selection screen when setting up our connector.Work That Sheet\nWith our data imported, create a new worksheet. If you've used Tableau before\nyou're probably very aware of the default column limit on Worksheets. Before we\ndo anything, go to Analysis  > Table Layout  > Advanced  to increase the max\ncolumns from 6 to whatever, let's say 12.\n\nWARING: super sick advanced Tableau hacks incoming.Drag your data into the\n\"rows\" shelf to get something like this:\n\nOur first look at the data.There are a few problems here we need to clean up.\nFirst, take a look at the \"Epic Color\" column.\n\nEyes as Blue as ghx-label-7\nFor some reason, JIRA finds it appropriate to label its colors this cryptic\n code of ghx-label-#. Go ahead and add this to the long list of shitty decisions\nAtlassian has chosen to pursue.\n\nKeeping our goal in mind, we need \"epic colors\" to add some style and flavor to\nour board. Could we make the board without this? Probably, if you're a quitter.\nI'm going to save you some time here. I went ahead and inspected the epic\nelements in my JIRA instance to extract their hex values.

We're\nlooking at a list of issues  here, where epics  are themselves to be considered\nan issue. Therefore, only issues which are epics will have colors: issues which\nare linked  to said epics, however, will not. This is annoying. It took me a bit\nto come up with the following solution, although I'd be curious to hear if\nanybody has a better way of doing this.\n\nGo ahead and create a new worksheet.

Originally I made the mistake of not doing this, only to realize\nthat Tableau will not export merged cells into a CSV. We need to order our\ncolumns starting with the most unique first to avoid any cell merging.\n\nExport that bad boy.\n\nThis is where we'll import our data into MongoDB. How dope is MongoDB, you ask?\nWell, one feature is the ability to import a CSV into an empty database to\nautomatically create the resulting schema and populate it with your values.\nYeah, it's that sick.\n\nI won't turn this into a MongoDB tutorial. Setting up a MongoDB Atlas cluster is\nsomewhat straightforward, and we can use the MongoDB Compass  client to simply\nimport the CSV we created.\n\nWhat Next?\nAs mentioned, our first take at this is going to be a dry run of building this\nwidget with our initial data import. We'll be building this widget in an\nExpressJS app, so next we'll focus on how to connect our app to MongoDB and\nextract this data.\n\nAfter that, we'll need to find a way to automate this process moving forward.\nFull disclosure: Tableau most definitely will not play nice with this, and I'm\niffy on how possible this is. All I know is I've got a Tableau Server instance\nup and running, and I paid good money for it. Therefore, it is my right to break\nit.\n\nI hope at least one or two people have found this to be helpful or interesting\nthus far. Again, I realize this process is a completely roundabout way of\naccomplishing this task... this is mostly a way for us to learn the ins-and-outs\nof these systems. Perhaps we might even build something special. Just think: if\nwe manage to close the loop on this system, we can leverage a GUI to create apps\nnearly as fast as we can imagine them.","html":"<p>Greetings to all my feathered friends upon this fine Memorial Day weekend.

Hopefully this gave you a feel of how a pivot table works, and if\nyour synapses are wired in a very specific way  you may even begin to feel out\nwhy pivot tables are such a game-changer. With this base in mind, in this post,\nwe're going to learn what each of those buckets actually do, and explore some\nreally cool ways that you can mess with your raw data within the pivot\nenvironment.\n\nBefore we go further, we must first understand some foundation facts about\nworking with Pivots that will save you heartache and frustration out of the\nprocess:\n\n 1.   Remember, any data within the pivot table does not affect the raw data,\n    this makes pivot tables the ideal way to look at your data through different\n    lenses. \n 2.   You can utilize a heading in your pivot table in multiple locations (or\n    even multiple times in the same location!) to view your data in different\n    ways. The exact way this works is difficult to explain, so try it yourself\n    and find out. \n 3.   Any changes to your raw data (especially if you didn't highlight the\n    entirety of your data) will not  be reflected in the pivot table UNLESS you\n    right click the table, and press \"refresh\", this will then take into account\n    any data changed in the raw data (assuming that the change took place within\n    the area you highlighted, if you add a column or row, you need to redo the\n    table) \n 4.   You can copy/paste any part of the pivot table, and contents that you\n    highlighted to copy will appear. HOWEVER, if you highlight all  visible\n    parts of the pivot table, you'll actually copy the whole pivot (which you\n    can continue modifying). This is very useful if you want to make a minor\n    change to a pivot table, and compare them side by side (we'll dive deeper\n    into this topic in a later post). \n 5.   This isn't exclusive to pivot tables, but remember the absolute golden\n    rule  of Excel: much like an obnoxiously large Leatherman (or a Swiss army\n    knife, depending on how over-prepared you want to be) while there are nearly\n    infinite tools or settings available, a hypermajority  of Excel users will\n    never touch even half of the options available, and are still strong in the\n    ways of magic (#wizard), so just because you can press all the buttons,\n    doesn't mean you should. \n\nWith all three of these rules in mind, let's dive into each of the buckets, what\nthey do, and how you can use this to really start to get wild with your data.\nLet's start with the most straightforward:\n\nFilters\nThe filter bucket allows you to place one (or more!) of your headings (AKA your\ncolumns in the raw data) in order to filter in or out those values out of the\nentire pivot table. For instance, If you have a column of people's names, and\nyou put names into the filter bucket, you can then choose the names that you\nwant to include the associated data. One great use for the filter bucket is if\nyou have a dataset with dates, you can filter out a specific Month/Day/Year and\nthe rest of your data will only display information from that particular time\nperiod.\n\nRows\nRows are the bread and butter of a pivot table (and as we discussed last time,\nthe thing that clicking on a heading defaults to). This is the main area where\nyour data will live. For example, if you have a dataset of Names, IDs, and\nBirthdays, and you click Names, the pivot table will show all of the DISTINCT \nnames in a column within the pivot. For example, if you have the dataset of\nnames:\n\nCOLUMN A COLUMN B Bob Sally Bob Jim Tom Larry Bob Your pivot table will display:\n\nCOLUMN A COLUMN B Bob Sally Jim Tom Larry In other words, it treats all Bobs the\nsame, and this functionality is *Muy importanté\n\nHowever, what if you want to see how many Bobs exist within your data? Well...\n\nValues\nThe values tab is perhaps the most flexible part of the pivot table. By putting\na heading within the value tab, it will default to showing you the Count, or the\nnumber of appearances that a particular value shows up within a column of your\ndataset. So for example, if you drag names into both the row and values buckets,\nyou'll wind up with this (a pivot table will always show a grand total (unless\nyou specifically tell the pivot not to, which is a possibility, however, because\nyou can copy and paste any part of the pivot, it's rarely necessary):\n\n             COLUMN ACOLUMN B        Bob3        Sally1        Bob1        Jim1\n       Tom1        **Total****7**\n\nNow, notice that above I said that by dragging a heading into the values bucket\nit'll default to a count (unless the column is all numbers, then it'll default\nto a sum), however, this is not the only possibility. By left clicking the\nheading within the value bucket and choosing \"value field settings), you can\nchoose from a mind-boggling array of possible mathematical operations, the ones\nthat you will generally use most often are probably going to be count  (the\nnumber of appearances of a given value within a dataset) and sum  (the combined\ntotal of all the numbers associated with each value in your row bucket). One\nimportant piece of advice though, you can not  sum text, Excel won't let you\n(even if the text looks like a number), so if you're using numbers, be sure to\ntell Excel that you're looking at numbers (this issue will happen more often\nthan you could possibly imagine!)\n\nOther useful operators are count distinct  (which you can only utilize if you\nchecked add to data model  when you built the table) and min or max (returning\nthe lowest or highest value associated with a particular value in your rows, and\nyou can only use this if you did not  click add to data model  when you built\nthe table). A good example of using Max or Min is when you have say names and\nsalaries, where you can show the highest and lowest salary for a particular\nname. Keep in mind that you can have more than one value operator (like min and\nmax) per heading, thus putting both the minimum and maximum value next to each\nother on the table. Which leads us to the generally least used bucket...\n\nColumns\nOne thing I intentionally left out was what a pivot table actually does  with\nyour data. A gross over-simplification of the functionality is that it\nconsolidates (picking out those distinct values), summarizes (shows totals, and\ngrand totals), and most importantly, it flips your columns and rows (hence the\nreason it's called a pivot  table.) Thus, the column bucket is generally just\nused as a place where your values go automatically when you populate the values\nbucket. The reason columns get kind of cumbersome is because it literally widens\nyour pivot by how many ever values exist in your dataset, thus, anything more\nthan say 20 values becomes almost impossible to read, let alone use in a\nmeaningful way.\n\nThere are some rare cases in which using a heading in the column bucket may make\nsense though, for instance, if you have birth months as one of your headings,\nand names for rows, you can put the months in the column bucket and then get a\ncount showing each how many people with a particular name land at a particular\nmonth in a grid or \"heat map\" (a fancy way to say a chart showing concentrations\nof something) fashion. Another use case (and one I use on the day to day) is\nfinding the numbers of providers who utilize a particular procedure for which\nthere is a known value (there are 12 that I look at). You have the procedure\nnames as the columns, and you have the providers who administer the procedures\nas the rows. You then put measure in the value bucket. This gives me a nice,\nconcise grid for which I can see which providers give how many of which of the\n12 procedures...which on it's own is sorta useful, but when combined with a\ntrick we already learned, some epic level spellcasting is afoot. Unfortunately,\nthat'll have to wait until next time.\n\nIn summary, we learned:\n\n * The purpose of the filter bucket within a pivot table\n * The purpose of the rows bucket within a pivot table and the fact that it\n   shows distinct values\n * The purpose of the values bucket within a pivot table, and how you can have\n   the column use different mathematical operators (such as count, sum, min, and\n   max) to find different information within a dataset... and\n * The purpose (or lack thereof) of the columns bucket within a pivot table, and\n   potential use case scenarios for this function.\n\nNext time, we start combining knowledge in order to get freaky with your data in\nways that the lord of Excel themselves did not consider.\n\nPivot till you puke,\n\n-Snacks","html":"<p>During the last discussion, you've (hopefully) learned how to generate a pivot table, and learned about the four \"buckets\" that can house your columns:</p><ul><li>Filter</li><li>Row</li><li>Column</li><li>Value</li></ul><p>I'm also going to make the wild assumption that you've played around with your newly birthed pivot table, taking your column headings from your \"raw\" data (in the lingua franca of the numerically inclined, this means the data just as you've received it, before you add formulae or engage in any other manipulation.)

Simply put, building a pivot table is the reason \nwhy Excel is still used at all (and as of about a month ago, Google Sheets has\npivot tables too, so that's encouraging). It essentially offers a way to \nsummarize your data  and quickly draw conclusions from a bunch of random rows\nand columns. If that sounds very powerful, you're correct, and it would be easy\nenough to write an entire book just about pivot tables (and I'm sure these books\nexist), but right now, we're just going to learn to build one.\n\nThe good news is, pivoting doesn't even require a formula to exist, it only\nrequires at least two columns with headings  (this is the number one reason for\npivot tables not working out) and the desire to succeed.\n\nHere's how to do it:\n\n 1. MAKE SURE ALL OF YOUR COLUMNS HAVE HEADINGS\n 2. Highlight all of the data you want to pivot (there's the sucker way to do\n    this: pressing control-A  to highlight everything, and the more accurate\n    way: highlight the first heading, and then hit control+shift+right  to\n    highlight all the headings, and then control+shift+down  to highlight all\n    the data related to those headings, this removes blanks from the pivot\n    table). Ultimately though, highlight the data anyway that makes you happy,\n    the important thing is to include all the data you want to pivot out.\n 3.

Simply put, building a pivot table is <strong>the reason</strong> why Excel is still used at all (and as of about a month ago, Google Sheets has pivot tables too, so that's encouraging). It essentially offers a way to <strong>summarize your data</strong> and quickly draw conclusions from a bunch of random rows and columns. If that sounds very powerful, you're correct, and it would be easy enough to write an entire book just about pivot tables (and I'm sure these books exist), but right now, we're just going to learn to build one.</p><p>The good news is, pivoting doesn't even require a formula to exist, it only requires at least two columns <strong>with headings</strong> (this is the number one reason for pivot tables not working out) and the desire to succeed.</p><p>Here's how to do it:</p><ol><li>MAKE SURE ALL OF YOUR COLUMNS HAVE HEADINGS</li><li>Highlight all of the data you want to pivot (there's the sucker way to do this: pressing <strong>control-A</strong> to highlight everything, and the more accurate way: highlight the first heading, and then hit <strong>control+shift+right</strong> to highlight all the headings, and then <strong>control+shift+down</strong> to highlight all the data related to those headings, this removes blanks from the pivot table). Ultimately though, highlight the data anyway that makes you happy, the important thing is to include all the data you want to pivot out.</li><li>Click insert at the top of your screen (in between home and page layout...not the inset key), alternatively, you can hit Alt+D and then P to open the wizard, but the wizard actually makes things more difficult (in my opinion, of course).

With this knowledge, you've actually been armed\nwith the keys to the kingdom, and you're finally going to learn how to do\nsomething fancy.\n\nThere comes a time in every person's life where just by learning one piece of\ninformation, suddenly everything else you've learned clicks into place. For\nthose who utilize Excel, learning this formula WILL  BE THAT FOR YOU. In our\nlast entry, I stated very plainly that there are only a handful of formulae that\nare used on a regular basis, and this is easily the most useful and  the most\nflexible, to the point in which knowing how to use this formula (along with a\ntool that we'll discuss next time) are the SOLE job skills required to get an\nentry level job in finance note...put this somewhere on your resume.\n\nWhat is this mythical savior of white collar workers worldwide? In the past, you\nmay have heard muffled whispers of \"v-lookup\" or if your data was particularly\npoorly formatted perhaps even \"h-lookup\", however, after 2007, the minds behind\nthe spreadsheets threw both of those formulae into a blender, mixed it with\nRedbull and amphetamines, and spit out the king of functions: the =Index(Match))\n.\n\nSo, after all that incredibly well deserved hype, what is index-match, and why\nis it so special? To put things incredibly simply, index-match checks (or as the\ncool kids say: \"bump-up against\" one piece of information (say, a list of ID\nnumbers) against another piece of information (say a second list of IDs) and\nspits out the data associated with the matching values (Say, the name associated\nwith that ID number). The reasons for the importance of these commands can not\nbe overstated, as anyone who works with data in any capacity knows that\nidentifying changes (and where the changes are) over different iterations of a\nparticular dataset is an essential  job function.\n\nNow, hopefully you're starting to see the light, and understanding the power\nthat this formula holds, so now we're going to learn how to use it.\nFirst things first, if you're a particularly perceptive reader, you may have\nguessed from how I wrote the formula that =Index(Match)) is actually the\ncombination of two separate formulae that alone are of limited use, but\ntogether, they allow you to accomplish great things. These two formulae are:\n\n 1. INDEX  which asks to look at an array (essentially a list of cells), and\n    pull out the data at a specific row and column number within that array (\n    interesting fact: despite using letters for columns and numbers for rows,\n    Excel actually translates the column letters into a number with 1=A and so\n    on). Index by itself isn't super useful, as, much like when you're viewing a\n    particle, or cooking Meth, you rarely know both dimensions of a cell that\n    you're looking for (that was a Heisenberg uncertainty principle joke...or a\n    Breaking Bad reference, depending on how you roll.)\n 2. MATCH  is the formula that does most of the heavy lifting. Match checks to\n    see where a value exists within an array that you specify, and returns the\n    position in the array (for example, if you match \"C\" on a list of letters of\n    the Roman alphabet, match will tell you \"3\").\n\nNow here's where the magic happens. Remember when I said that everything in\nExcel is basically just a collection of numbers? Well, in that respect when a\nformula asks you for a number, there's no reason why you can't throw in ANOTHER \nformula that spits out a number. As such, if you tell Index where you want to\ngrab something from, and then instead of giving it a position, you give it the\nnumber that pops up from Match (which is a formula which gives you the location\nof where something matches) you've given Index all the information it needs to\ndo it's work, all without needing to know where (or if at all) the value exists.\n\nThe formula in practice is written like this:\n\n**=INDEX(*column or row where you want to grab the information from*,MATCH(*the cell containing the value that you want to look for*,*column or row where you want to check for the value*,0)) (don't forget the zero at the end, that just means you want to match the value exactly)\n\nAs such, if you have the following data\n\nSheet 1\nCOLUMN ACOLUMN B\n 1bob\n 2sam\n 3steve\n 4larry\n Sheet 2\nCOLUMN ACOLUMN B\n 2\n 3\n 12\n 18\n If you want to return the name associated with any of the numbers in sheet 2,\nyou can plug the column containing the names in the Index, the cell containing\nthe value that you want to find the associated name with as the first part of\nthe match, and the column containing the IDs associated with the names as the\nsecond part of the match, the formula will spit out the name (or an error\nstating that the value doesn't match a name). The best part is, this formula can\nget dragged down the entire list of numbers to return the names associated with \nall  of the IDs. Now, this is with a very small set of data, but it works just\nas well, and just as quickly if you're looking at 10,000 IDs.\n\nWith that being said, I hope you've learned the answer to a question you didn't\neven know you had, and I hope index-match starts saving you time (or snagging\nyou a promotion!) immediately.\n\nIn summary we've learned the following:\n\n 1. The function of INDEX\n 2. The function of MATCH (protip: if all you want to do is see if something\n    matches and don't need to see what it's associated with, you can use match\n    by itself, is =ISNUMBER(Match)) which will give you a nice true false\n 3. How you can utilize a formula as a variable in another formula (you don't\n    need to put in a second equals sign if you're doing this, but you do need\n    another set of parenthesis)\n 4. How to write an Index(Match)) formula\n 5. The main use for Index-Match (by thinking outside the box, there are an\n    infinite number of uses)\n 6. The realization that by knowing this formula, you never need to compare\n    things by hand again and eye again!\n\nNext time, we'll discuss the other frequently used Excel tool, that together\nwith the powers of Index-Match, literally make up the entry level analyst's\ntoolkit. Also, as a bonus entry in the interim, you'll get a quick rundown of\nhow you can leverage your knowledge of Index-match in a conversation with\nsomeone who knows what they're talking about.\n\nIn Hoc Signo,\n\n-Snacks","html":"<p>In my last entry, we discussed how to write a formula, and you've been armed with what each piece of the formula represents (the command, the variables, and the definition of an array).

In the past, you may have heard muffled whispers of \"v-lookup\" or if your data was particularly poorly formatted perhaps even \"h-lookup\", however, after 2007, the minds behind the spreadsheets threw both of those formulae into a blender, mixed it with Redbull and amphetamines, and spit out the king of functions: the <code>=Index(Match))</code>.</p><p>So, after all that incredibly well deserved hype, what is index-match, and why is it so special? To put things incredibly simply, index-match checks (or as the cool kids say: \"bump-up against\" one piece of information (say, a list of ID numbers) against another piece of information (say a second list of IDs) and spits out the data associated with the matching values (Say, the name associated with that ID number). The reasons for the importance of these commands can not be overstated, as anyone who works with data in any capacity knows that identifying changes (and where the changes are) over different iterations of a particular dataset is an <strong>essential</strong> job function.</p><p>Now, hopefully you're starting to see the light, and understanding the power that this formula holds, so now we're going to learn how to use it.<br>First things first, if you're a particularly perceptive reader, you may have guessed from how I wrote the formula that =Index(Match)) is actually the combination of two separate formulae that alone are of limited use, but together, they allow you to accomplish great things. These two formulae are:</p><ol><li><strong>INDEX</strong> which asks to look at an array (essentially a list of cells), and pull out the data at a specific row and column number within that array (<em>interesting fact: despite using letters for columns and numbers for rows, Excel actually translates the column letters into a number with 1=A and so on)</em>. Index by itself isn't super useful, as, much like when you're viewing a particle, or cooking Meth, you rarely know both dimensions of a cell that you're looking for (that was a Heisenberg uncertainty principle joke...or a Breaking Bad reference, depending on how you roll.)</li><li><strong>MATCH</strong> is the formula that does most of the heavy lifting. Match checks to see where a value exists within an array that you specify, and returns the position in the array (for example, if you match \"C\" on a list of letters of the Roman alphabet, match will tell you \"3\").</li></ol><p>Now here's where the magic happens. Remember when I said that everything in Excel is basically just a collection of numbers? Well, in that respect when a formula asks you for a number, there's no reason why you can't throw in <strong>ANOTHER</strong> formula that spits out a number. As such, if you tell Index where you want to grab something from, and then instead of giving it a position, you give it the number that pops up from Match (which is a formula which gives you the location of where something matches) you've given Index all the information it needs to do it's work, all without needing to know where (or if at all) the value exists.</p><p>The formula in practice is written like this:</p><pre><code>**=INDEX(*column or row where you want to grab the information from*,MATCH(*the cell containing the value that you want to look for*,*column or row where you want to check for the value*,0)) (don't forget the zero at the end, that just means you want to match the value exactly)</code></pre><p>As such, if you have the following data</p><h3 id=\"sheet-1\">Sheet 1</h3><table>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr><th>COLUMN A</th><th>COLUMN B</th></tr>\n        <tr><td>1</td><td>bob</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>2</td><td>sam</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>3</td><td>steve</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>4</td><td>larry</td></tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table><h3 id=\"sheet-2\">Sheet 2</h3><table>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr><th>COLUMN A</th><th>COLUMN B</th></tr>\n        <tr><td>2</td><td></td></tr>\n        <tr><td>3</td><td></td></tr>\n        <tr><td>12</td><td></td></tr>\n        <tr><td>18</td><td></td></tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table><p>If you want to return the name associated with any of the numbers in sheet 2, you can plug the column containing the names in the Index, the cell containing the value that you want to find the associated name with as the first part of the match, and the column containing the IDs associated with the names as the second part of the match, the formula will spit out the name (or an error stating that the value doesn't match a name). The best part is, this formula can get dragged down the entire list of numbers to return the names associated with <strong>all</strong> of the IDs. Now, this is with a very small set of data, but it works just as well, and just as quickly if you're looking at 10,000 IDs.</p><p>With that being said, I hope you've learned the answer to a question you didn't even know you had, and I hope index-match starts saving you time (or snagging you a promotion!) immediately.</p><p>In summary we've learned the following:</p><ol><li>The function of INDEX</li><li>The function of MATCH (<em>protip: if all you want to do is see if something matches and don't need to see what it's associated with, you can use match by itself, is </em><code>=ISNUMBER(Match)</code><em>) which will give you a nice true false</em></li><li>How you can utilize a formula as a variable in another formula (you don't need to put in a second equals sign if you're doing this, but you do need another set of parenthesis)</li><li>How to write an Index(Match)) formula</li><li>The main use for Index-Match (by thinking outside the box, there are an infinite number of uses)</li><li>The realization that by knowing this formula, you never need to compare things by hand again and eye again!</li></ol><p>Next time, we'll discuss the other frequently used Excel tool, that together with the powers of Index-Match, literally make up the entry level analyst's toolkit. Also, as a bonus entry in the interim, you'll get a quick rundown of how you can leverage your knowledge of Index-match in a conversation with someone who knows what they're talking about.</p><p>In Hoc Signo,</p><p>-Snacks</p>","url":"https://hackersandslackers.com/the-one-excel-formula-to-rule-them-all/","uuid":"59f81d21-fa84-4849-8506-a175860704bc","page":false,"codeinjection_foot":"","codeinjection_head":"","comment_id":"5aff2f668ba5ce278d71d6c5"}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c12d7bfe875ad7bb8673656","title":"Excel Showdown: Index Match vs. \"The Lookups\"","slug":"excel-index-match-vs-lookups","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://hackersandslackers.com/content/images/2018/05/excel5@2x.jpg","excerpt":"Learn to hate V-Lookups and H-Lookups in favor of Index Match.","custom_excerpt":"Learn to hate V-Lookups and H-Lookups in favor of Index Match.","created_at_pretty":"18 May, 2018","published_at_pretty":"18 May, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"20 January, 2019","created_at":"2018-05-18T16:57:14.000-04:00","published_at":"2018-05-18T16:00:00.000-04:00","updated_at":"2019-01-20T18:19:45.000-05:00","meta_title":"Excel Showdown: Index Match vs. \"The Lookups\" | Hackers and Slackers","meta_description":"Learn to hate V-Lookups and H-Lookups in favor of Index Match.","og_description":"Learn to hate V-Lookups and H-Lookups in favor of Index Match.","og_image":"https://hackersandslackers.com/content/images/2018/05/excel5@2x.jpg","og_title":"Excel Showdown: Index Match vs. \"The Lookups\"","twitter_description":"Learn to hate V-Lookups and H-Lookups in favor of Index Match.","twitter_image":"https://hackersandslackers.com/content/images/2018/05/excel5@2x.jpg","twitter_title":"Excel Showdown: Index Match vs. \"The Lookups\"","authors":[{"name":"Max Mileaf","slug":"snacks","bio":"One of three therapists in the known universe who knows how to use a computer.

As such, I'm forced to do\na similar job as my comrades using the tool that everyone has: Excel. Luckily,\nExcel has nearly infinite functionality for those that seek to explore\nfurther... Join me in this first of a series of indefinite length: Excel data\nmanipulation, where we get you hooked on the gateway drug of data analysis,\nstarting from absolute ground zero.\n\nSo, for a fitting first entry... how to turn Excel into more than just a fancy\ncalculator.\n\nStep 1: Click file, options, customize ribbon. Then see how there's one box on\nthe right that isn't checked by default that says \"developer\", check it and see\nhow deep the rabbit hole goes. Congrats, You're now officially more advanced\nthan 85% of people who use Excel.\n\nStep 2: Hit alt (or command...I guess) F11, don't ask why, just do it. This will\nopen up the Excel VB Editor where you can actually engage in making Excel do\nwhatever you want it to. Also, a fun fact for later, keyboard shortcuts are your\nbest friend.\n\nStep 3: Google for whatever it is you want to do followed by the word \"Excel,\"\nbecause someone already wrote the code for it. Feel free to copy and paste it\nwithout mercy. This is how you learn, this is how everyone starts. Perhaps one\nday you will be able to write code that will assist another in this journey.\n\nStep 4: After copying the charitable programmer's code, click back to that VB\neditor write click the name of the sheet you're working on, hit insert, then\nmodule, then paste that code in there. Then hit save, and feel free to close the\nVB editor.\n\nHere's a useful tool to get you started: TEXTJOIN\n```\n\n----copy this whole thing----\nFunction TEXTJOIN(delimiter As String, ignore_empty As Boolean, ParamArray cell_ar() As Variant)\nFor Each cellrng In cell_ar\nFor Each cell In cellrng\nIf ignore_empty = False Then\nresult = result & cell & delimiter\nElseIf cell <> \"\" Then\nresult = result & cell & delimiter\nEnd If\nEnd If\nNext cell\nNext cellrng\nTEXTJOIN = Left(result, Len(result) - Len(delimiter))\nEnd Function\n----stop copying---\n\nStep 5: Go back to that VB editor, right click the name of the sheet you're\nworking on, click insert, and then paste everything in the last step into the\nwindow. Hit save, and close the editor. Don't save it in \"Personal\" just yet,\nthat's for another time.\n\nStep 6:  start with the formula =textjoin  (we'll talk more about formulas\nlater), and watch as a formula that didn't exist before suddenly does because\nYOU DID THAT!\nWhat this does is take the information in any row or column and combine it with\na \"delimiter\" that you choose (the \";\" semicolon is popular for reasons we will\ndiscuss later) into one giant cell. No longer do you need to type\n=concatenate(click, \";\", click) 1000 times to combine the cells in a list!\n\nStep 7: Save this file as a Macro enabled workbook, because if you want to use\nit again, your workbooks now need to be extra special.\n\nStep 8: The next time you need to concatenate an entire table of values for\nwhatever reason, plop that in there, and do what they assume is going to be a\nfull day's work in 45 seconds.\n\nSo, I hope that helped just a little bit, and we'll be back next time to learn\nhow to use Excel's overly complex series of formulas to do things that Excel\nreally shouldn't be used for, but who are we kidding?
