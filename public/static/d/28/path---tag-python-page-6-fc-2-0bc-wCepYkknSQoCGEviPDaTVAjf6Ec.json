Sometimes we waste\nweeks of our lives thanks to an unreasonable and unknowledgeable stakeholder.\nOther times, we need to deal with XML trees.\n\nAt some point or another you're going to need to work with an API that returns\ninformation in XML format. \"Sure,\" we might think, \"I'll just import the\nstandard Python XML package, pick up some syntax nuances, and be on my way.\"\nThat's what I thought too. Today we're going to look at said library, the XML\nElementTree [https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html] \nlibrary, and see firsthand why this might not be the case.\n\nAs always, the purpose of this is to hopefully save somebody pain. Feel free to\nstash this in your back pocket until XML becomes a problem for you; I'm doing\nthe same.\n\nIt Can't be That Bad\nLet's tackle a few things upfront to save a couple hours of confusion.\n\nFirst off, you know how you've been dot notation to transverse object trees?\nYeah, we can't do that with XML. If we're looking for the child  of a parent, \nparent.child  simply does not work (no, parent['child'] doesn't work either). I\nhope you like looping through trees.\n\nPrint the value of an item in an XML tree doesn’t show you that item's value,\nnor does it show children of that item. It instead prints <Element\n'{http://www.example.com/servicemodel/resources}ItemName' at 0x7fadcf3f83b8>,\nwhich is like a Python equivalent of Javascript's [object Object] in terms of\nusefulness. We can use .text  to see the text value instead of an XML element;.\nGood luck on the other thing, though.\n\nGoing Green\nLet's get this over with and plant some XML trees. I'm going to assume we're\nworking from an API response here.\n\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n\ne = ET.fromstring(response.content)\n\n\nIf we were reading an XML file, we'd have to read the file and explicitly search\nfor the root. Even though this doesn’t pertain to us, we should still be aware\nof this inconsistency to avoid future confusion:\n\ne = ET.parse('data.xml')\nroot = e.getroot()\n\n\nWhen we loop through this tree, we 'll need to be mindful of the 3 ways we can\ninteract with XML data. Let's use this tree as an example:\n\n<beer name=\"Bud Light\">\n    <flavor>Water</flavor>\n    <type>Frat</type>\n    <rank>0</rank>\n</beer>\n<beer name=\"PBR\">\n    <flavor>Urine</flavor>\n    <type>Ironic</type>\n    <rank>1</rank>\n</beer>\n<beer name=\"IPA\">\n    <flavor>Pretentious</flavor>\n    <type>Hipster</type>\n    <rank>2</rank>\n</beer>\n\n\n * item.tag  returns the name of the tag. Running this on the first item would\n   return beer, as well as an associated URI.\n * item.attrib()  returns the attributes of the selected item ({'name': 'Bud\n   Light'})\n * item.text  returns the value of text between the open and close tags, if\n   exists.\n\nFinding Stuff\nThere's a few ways to find the data we need in an XML tree, the most obvious of\nwhich would be searching by index. item[0][1]  works, although I have a feeling\nindex-based searching isn't going to be that useful for you.\n\nThe .find and .findall Methods\nOur library has built in .find  and .findall  methods for us to work through a\ntree (returns wither one or all records, as you might have guessed). We search\nby element name as part of a loop:\n\nfor beer in e.findall('beer'):\n    name = beer.get('name') # equivalent to .attrib() in this case\n    flavor = beer.find('flavor').text\n    print(name, \" is \", flavor)\n    \n    \nBud Light is Water    \nPBR is Urine\nIPA is Pretentious\n\n\nThe .iter() Method\nWe can loop through all occurrences of a n element name by using .iter().\n\nfor beertype in e.findall('beer'):\n    print(beertype)\n    \n Frat\n Ironic\n Hipster\n\n\nUsing Some Sort of God-Awful Loop\nIf you're like me you may just skip reading all the documentation altogether,\nget obscenely frustrated, and create some garbage like this:\n\nfor beer in e:\n    for properties in beer:\n          if item.tag == \"{http://www.example.com/beermodel/resources}Type\":\n               print(type)\n                   \nFrat\nIronic\nHipster\n\n\n\nNow that's pretty awful, but I can't tell you had to live your life. You do you.\n\nIn Conclusion\nLook, XML just sucks: don't use it if you don't have to. If you do, save\nyourself some time by coming back to this page.","html":"<p>Life is filled with things we don't want to do; you're a developer so you probably understand this to a higher degree than most people. Sometimes we waste weeks of our lives thanks to an unreasonable and unknowledgeable stakeholder. Other times, we need to deal with XML trees.</p><p>At some point or another you're going to need to work with an API that returns information in XML format. \"Sure,\" we might think, \"I'll just import the standard Python XML package, pick up some syntax nuances, and be on my way.\" That's what I thought too. Today we're going to look at said library, the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html\">XML ElementTree</a> library, and see firsthand why this might not be the case.</p><p>As always, the purpose of this is to hopefully save somebody pain. Feel free to stash this in your back pocket until XML becomes a problem for you; I'm doing the same.</p><h2 id=\"it-can-t-be-that-bad\">It Can't be That Bad</h2><p>Let's tackle a few things upfront to save a couple hours of confusion.</p><p>First off, you know how you've been dot notation to transverse object trees? Yeah, we can't do that with XML. If we're looking for the <em>child</em> of a <em>parent</em>, <strong>parent.child</strong> simply does not work (no, parent['child'] doesn't work either). I hope you like looping through trees.</p><p>Print the value of an item in an XML tree doesn’t show you that item's value, nor does it show children of that item. It instead prints <code>&lt;Element '{http://www.example.com/servicemodel/resources}ItemName' at 0x7fadcf3f83b8&gt;</code>, which is like a Python equivalent of Javascript's [object Object] in terms of usefulness. We can use <strong>.text</strong> to see the text value instead of an XML element;. Good luck on the other thing, though.</p><h2 id=\"going-green\">Going Green</h2><p>Let's get this over with and plant some XML trees. I'm going to assume we're working from an API response here.</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n\ne = ET.fromstring(response.content)\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we were reading an XML file, we'd have to read the file and explicitly search for the root. Even though this doesn’t pertain to us, we should still be aware of this inconsistency to avoid future confusion:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">e = ET.parse('data.xml')\nroot = e.getroot()\n</code></pre>\n<p>When we loop through this tree, we 'll need to be mindful of the 3 ways we can interact with XML data. Let's use this tree as an example:</p><pre><code class=\"language-xml\">&lt;beer name=&quot;Bud Light&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;flavor&gt;Water&lt;/flavor&gt;\n    &lt;type&gt;Frat&lt;/type&gt;\n    &lt;rank&gt;0&lt;/rank&gt;\n&lt;/beer&gt;\n&lt;beer name=&quot;PBR&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;flavor&gt;Urine&lt;/flavor&gt;\n    &lt;type&gt;Ironic&lt;/type&gt;\n    &lt;rank&gt;1&lt;/rank&gt;\n&lt;/beer&gt;\n&lt;beer name=&quot;IPA&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;flavor&gt;Pretentious&lt;/flavor&gt;\n    &lt;type&gt;Hipster&lt;/type&gt;\n    &lt;rank&gt;2&lt;/rank&gt;\n&lt;/beer&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<ul><li><strong>item.tag</strong> returns the name of the tag. Running this on the first item would return <em>beer</em>, as well as an associated URI.</li><li><strong>item.attrib()</strong> returns the attributes of the selected item (<em>{'name'</em>: <em>'Bud Light'</em>})</li><li><strong>item.text</strong> returns the value of text between the open and close tags, if exists.</li></ul><h2 id=\"finding-stuff\">Finding Stuff</h2><p>There's a few ways to find the data we need in an XML tree, the most obvious of which would be searching by index. <strong>item[0][1]</strong> works, although I have a feeling index-based searching isn't going to be that useful for you.</p><h3 id=\"the-find-and-findall-methods\">The .find and .findall Methods</h3><p>Our library has built in <strong>.find</strong> and <strong>.findall</strong> methods for us to work through a tree (returns wither one or all records, as you might have guessed).

Dim down\nthe lights and slip into something more comfortable as we take you on this 100%\norganic flavor extravaganza. Tonight's menu? A Python MySQL library: PyMySQL\n[https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL].\n\nPyMySQL is lightweight and perfect for fulfilling MySQL queries. If you want\nbells and whistles, you're probably barking up the wrong tree (and you probably\nshould’ve used a DB other than MySQL in the first place).\n\nWhy write tutorials for technologies we openly trash talk? Out of necessity, of\ncourse! There's nothing wrong with MySQL, most enterprises are married to it in\nsome way. Thus, A great use case for PyMySQL is for usage in AWS lambda when\nworking with large enterprise systems. We'll get to that, but for now let's cook\nup something good.\n\nHeat up the Stove\nTurn on the gas and prep the table to set with your favorite collection of\nplates! That's right, we're talking boilerplate. We knew this was coming; it\nseems like every time you want to do something tangibly cool, we need to get\ninto the business of managing connections and whatnot.\n\nTo ease the pain, I'll share with you a preferred method of handling opening\nconnections with PyMySQL. Here we set a function to separate basic connection\nlogic and error messaging from our app:\n\nimport sys\nimport pymysql\nimport logger\n\nconn = None\n\ndef openConnection():\n    global conn\n    try:\n        if(conn is None):\n            conn = pymysql.connect(rds_host, user=name, passwd=password, db=db_name, connect_timeout=5)\n        elif (not conn.open):\n            conn = pymysql.connect(rds_host, user=name, passwd=password, db=db_name, connect_timeout=5)    \n    except:\n        logger.error(\"ERROR: Unexpected error: Could not connect to MySql instance.\")\n        sys.exit()\n\n\n\nNothing fancy here: we set a global variable conn  to serve as our connection,\nand have some basic logic on how to interact with our database. Running \nopenConnection  will attempt to connect to a MySQL db with supplied credentials,\nor throw an error if something goes horribly wrong.\n\nNow we can keep this separate from the rest of our code. Out of sight, out of\nmind.\n\nMeat and Potatoes\nWith the boring stuff out of the way, let's dig into some goodness. We'll start\noff with a basic use case: selecting all rows from a table:\n\ndef getRecords():\n    try:\n        openConnection()\n        with conn.cursor() as cur:\n            sql = \"SELECT * FROM table\"\n            cur.execute(sql)\n            result = cur.fetchall()\n            print(result)\n            cur.close()\n            conn.close()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n    finally:\n        print('Query Successful')\n        \ngetRecords() \n\n\nWe split our function into your standard try/except/finally  breakdown. What\nwe're trying is opening a connection using the function we created earlier, and\nrunning queries against it.\n\nThe preferred syntax in PyMySQL is to keep our query in a single string, as seen\nin our variable sql. With our query ready, we need to execute  the query, fetch \nthe resulting records and print the result. We're sure to close the connection\nonce we're done with executing queries... this is critical to ensure db\nconnections don't stay active.\n\nSimple so far, but we're about to kick it up a notch.\n\nSelecting rows\nYou may have noticed we used .fetchall()  to select all records. This is\nimportant to differentiate from .fetchone(), which simply selects the first\nrecord.\n\nWe can iterate over the rows resulting from .fetchall()  with a simple loop, as\nshown in the example below. Beware: attempting to print the result of \n.fetchall()  will simply result in a single integer, which represents the number\nof rows fetched. If there are instances where we know only one record should be\nreturned, .fetchone()  should be used instead.\n\ndef getRecords(table):\n    try:\n        openConnection()\n        with conn.cursor() as cur:\n            sql = \"SELECT * FROM %s\"\n            cur.execute(sql, table)\n            result = cur.fetchall()\n            for row in result:\n                record = {\n                        'id': row[0],\n                        'name': row[1],\n                        'email': row[2],\n                        'phone': row[3],\n\n                    }\n            cur.close()\n            conn.close()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n    finally:\n        print('Query Successful')\n        \ngetRecords('table_name')       \n\n\nWhoa, what's with the %s? This is how we pass arguments into queries in PyMySQL.\nThe PyMySQL guys were kind enough to realize how obnoxious it is to constantly\nbreak strings to pass in variables - in the case of SQL queries, this beyond\nobnoxious and borderline unworkable. Remember that MySQL requires explicit\nquotations around passing string values, so queries such as these become a\nnonsensical jumble of escaped characters.\n\nPyMySQL supports backquotes: the distant cousin of the single quotation mark,\nAKA the diagonal quote thing above the tilde ~ button on your keyboard. You\nknow: `. If there comes a time to set a string within your query use this\nelusive quotation as such: sql = \"SELECT * FROM %s WHERE column_name =\n`somevalue`\"Updating Rows of Data\nArguments can be passed as anything inside a query: they simply appear in the\norder in which they are passed. In the below example, we pass table as an\nargument, as well values we want updated, and the identifier for target rows:\n\ndef getRecords(table, data):\n    try:\n        openConnection()\n        with conn.cursor() as cur:\n            sql = \"UPDATE %s SET date=%s, numsent=%s WHERE email = %s\"\n            cur.execute(sql, (table, data['date_sent'], data['status'], data['email']))\n            conn.commit()\n            cur.close()\n            conn.close()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n    finally:\n        print('Query Successful')\n\ndata = {\n    'date_sent': '12/01/2018'\n    'email': 'fakeemail@example.com'\n    'status': 'Confirmed'\n}\ngetRecords('table_name', data)       \n\n\nHeads up:  Note the line conn.commit(). Don't forget that - this is what\nactually commits the update to the database. Forgetting this line and wasting\nhours debugging is somewhat of a rite of passage, but let's just skip all that.\n\nFor Dessert: Usage in AWS Lambda\nIt is my treat to share with you my world famous copy & paste recipe for AWS\nLambda. Here we store all of our db credentials in a separate file called \nrdsconfig.py. We also enable logging to take us through what is happening each\nstep of the way:\n\nimport sys\nimport logging\nimport rds_config\nimport pymysql\n\n#rds settings\nrds_host  = \"rdsName.dfsd834mire.us-west-3.rds.amazonaws.com\"\nname = rds_config.db_username\npassword = rds_config.db_password\ndb_name = rds_config.db_name\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger()\nlogger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n\nconn = None\n\ndef openConnection():\n    global conn\n    try:\n        if(conn is None):\n            conn = pymysql.connect(rds_host, user=name, passwd=password, db=db_name, connect_timeout=10)\n        elif (not conn.open):\n            conn = pymysql.connect(rds_host, user=name, passwd=password, db=db_name, connect_timeout=10)\n    except:\n        logger.error(\"ERROR: Could not connect to MySql instance.\")\n        sys.exit()\n\n\nlogger.info(\"SUCCESS: Connection to RDS mysql instance succeeded\")\n\n\nWe thank you all for joining us in this adventure of tantalizing treats.
