Chances are if you're pursuing analysis that's\ngroundbreaking (or worthwhile), we're probably starting with some ugly, untapped\ninformation. It turns out Mapbox has an API specifically for this purpose: the \nMapbox Geocoding API [https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#geocoding].\n\nGeocoding  is a blanket term for turning vague information into specific\nLat/Long coordinates. How vague, you ask? The API covers:\n\n * Pinpointing exact location via street address.\n * Locating regions or cities by recognizable name (ie: Rio de Janeiro).\n * Locating cities by highly unspecific name (Geocoding for \"Springfield\" will\n   return results for 41 American cities)\n * Locating cities or venues by name within a given region (such as searching\n   for Ray's Pizza in NYC).\n\nWe can also use Geocoding to do the reverse of this, where passing in\ncoordinates will return location names. If you find this useful, I'm assuming\nyou're a spy.\n\nChipping Away at a Real Use Case\nIn a real-life example, I have two sets of data: one represents general places\nof residence for a particular sample group. The goal is to see how they interact\nwith the second dataset: a list of locations they will be traveling to. I'd love\nto go into more detail, but:\n\nI get one cliche meme per year.So how can we use the Mapbox Geocoding API to\nsystematically extract coordinates for thousands of addresses, from multiple\ndatasets? With Pandas, of course!\n\nI'm Just Happy to be Writing About Pandas Right Now\nPardon my excitement; I've been far overdue for posting anything Pandas-related.\nIt's been killing me on the inside.\n\nWe need to make sense of some vague data. As seen in our Citibike example\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/map-data-visualization-with-mapbox/], New York\nhas plenty of public datasets with information like Taxi pickup/dropoffs, public\ntransit, etc. These start and end points are typically too fluid to have\nLat/Long coordinates associated with them, so we'll add them in ourselves. Given\nthat we're about to pass hundreds or thousands of addresses and locations, we'll\nuse Pandas .apply()  to fill out the missing Lat/Long columns in our dataset. \n\nInstead of using Mapbox's Python SDK, I'll actually be using requests  to hit\nthe Mapbox REST API. For some reason, the Python SDK was a bit unpredictable on\nmy last run.*\n\n*UPDATE: the Python SDK \"wasn't working\" because I apparently don't know the\ndifference between longitude and latitude. Awesome, so I'm a moron.\n\nimport sys\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport requests\nimport json\n\n\nclass GeocodeAddresses:\n    \"\"\"Add missing lat/long information to exisiting dataset.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, address_data):\n        self.data = address_data\n        self.address_df = pd.read_csv(self.data)\n        self.complete_data = self.get_coords(self.address_df)\n\n\n    @classmethod\n    def get_coords(self, employee_address_df):\n        \"\"\"Fill Dataframe lat/long columns.\"\"\"\n\n        def fill_coords(row):\n            \"\"\"Create a route object by passing GeoJSON start/end objects.\"\"\"\n            base_url = 'https://api.mapbox.com/geocoding/v5/mapbox.places/'\n            address = str(row.home_address)\n            format = '.json'\n            endpoint = base_url + address + format\n            params = {\n                'access_token':  'pk.eyJ1IjNoYXJkd2VthisisreallolaXdyNHQ3OTUifQ.VTAUrmzD91Ppxr1AJww'\n            }\n            headers = {\n                'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n            }\n            r = requests.get(endpoint, params=params, headers=headers)\n            try:\n                Lat = r.json()['features'][0]['geometry']['coordinates'][0]\n                Long = r.json()['features'][0]['geometry']['coordinates'][1]\n                print(pd.Series([Lat, Long]))\n                return pd.Series([Lat, Long])\n            except IndexError:\n                pass\n\n        address_df[['Lat', 'Long']] = address_df.head(100).apply(fill_coords, axis=1)\n        address_df.to_csv('geocoded.csv')\n\n\nIn the above example, we're using .apply()  against an empty series (our\nLat/Long columns) as opposed to our entire Dataframe. When get_coords()  returns\ntwo values, these values will fill the empty columns on a per-row basis.\n\nFor the scope of this tutorial, we'll simply focus on getting these points\nplotted. Don't worry, this is only part 2 of our Mapbox series! Yes, an entire\nseries!\n\nTurning Your Datasets into Tilesets\nIn Mapbox terms, a Tileset  is essentially a layer of data we can overlay on top\nof our blank map. The map style  we created last time was really just the\naesthetic unpinning of all the interesting data we can pile on time.\n\nTilesets can be stacked on one another, thus giving us infinite possibilities of\nthe types of data we can communicate: especially when you consider that Mapbox\nsupports Heatmaps and topology - far more than just plotted points.\n\nFirst, we'll plot our origins. I've put together a dataset of completely\nfalsified names (with presumably real addresses?) to demonstrate how we'd plot\nthese points.

Using Mapbox Studio\n[https://www.mapbox.com/studio/datasets/], we can upload our data and turn it\ninto a tileset; the heart and soul of what makes our maps interesting. \n\nOnce you've uploaded your CSV (or JSON, or whatever) as a dataset, we can\nimmediately see what this information looks like on a map by previewing it as a\ntileset. Mapbox is surprisingly intelligent in that it can deduce lat/long\nvalues from poorly named or formatted columns (such as Lat/Long, \nLatitutde/Longitude, start_longitude_lol/start_latitude_lmao, etc). Mapbox gets\nit right most of the time.\n\nIf y'all went well you should see a cluster of points on a map - this is a\npreview of your Tileset. Think of this as a layer in Photoshop: we can stack\nthese layers of information atop one another continuously to make something\ngreater than the sum of its parts.\n\nIf all looks good, export your Tileset via the \"export\" button on the top right.\n\nUpload your dataset and click \"edit\"Switch Over to Your Map \"Style\"\nYou map 'style' is your blank canvas. Get in there and add a layer, and from\nthere select the Tileset you just created. Once your Tileset is loaded, you can\nstyle the points themselves and even label them with the data in your dataset as\nyou see fit:\n\nSo many colorful layers.Simply clicking around the preloaded Tilesets should\nstart giving you ideas of what's possible down the line. Just look at those\nhorrifically bright Miami Vice themed streets.\n\nFeel free to get creative with Mapbox's tools to clarify the visual story you're\ntrying to tell. I've distinguished points from others after adding a third data\nset: Every Starbucks in New York City.  Yes, those map pins have been replaced\nwith that terrifying Starbucks Logo Mermaid Sea-demon\n\nTake a look at that perfect grid of mocha frappa-whatevers and tell me these\nguys don't have a business strategy:\n\nGod that's an ugly map.For all it's worth, I'd like to sincerely apologize for\nblinding your eyes with classless use of gifs paired with the useless corporate\nmonstrosity of a map I've created. I have faith that you'll do better.\n\nNow that we've spent enough time covering the n00b stuff, it's time to take the\ngloves off. While Mapbox studio's GUI serves as an amazing crutch and way to\ncustomize the look of our data, we must not forget: we're programmers, God damn\nit! True magic lies in 1s and 0s, not WYSIWYG editors.\n\nUntil we start using Plot.ly Dash, that is.\n\n(Suddenly, thousands of fans erupt into a roaring cheer at the very mention of\nPlot.ly. It's about time.™)","html":"<p>This wouldn't be a proper data blog unless we spend a vast majority of our time talking about cleaning data.

id=\"head-over-to-mapbox-studio\">Head Over to Mapbox Studio</h3><p>While we can technically do everything programmatically, Mapbox's GUI is simply too easy to ignore. Using <a href=\"https://www.mapbox.com/studio/datasets/\">Mapbox Studio</a>, we can upload our data and turn it into a <em><strong>tileset; </strong></em>the heart and soul of what makes our maps interesting. </p><p>Once you've uploaded your CSV (or JSON, or whatever) as a dataset, we can immediately see what this information looks like on a map by previewing it as a tileset. Mapbox is surprisingly intelligent in that it can deduce lat/long values from poorly named or formatted columns (such as <em>Lat/Long</em>, <em>Latitutde/Longitude</em>, <em>start_longitude_lol/start_latitude_lmao</em>, etc). Mapbox gets it right most of the time.</p><p>If y'all went well you should see a cluster of points on a map - this is a preview of your Tileset. Think of this as a layer in Photoshop: we can stack these layers of information atop one another continuously to make something greater than the sum of its parts.</p><p>If all looks good, export your Tileset via the \"export\" button on the top right.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://res-4.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/q_auto/v1/images/tileset.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Upload your dataset and click \"edit\"</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h3 id=\"switch-over-to-your-map-style\">Switch Over to Your Map \"Style\"</h3><p>You map 'style' is your blank canvas. Get in there and add a layer, and from there select the Tileset you just created. Once your Tileset is loaded, you can style the points themselves and even label them with the data in your dataset as you see fit:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://res-2.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/q_auto/v1/images/layers.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>So many colorful layers.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Simply clicking around the preloaded Tilesets should start giving you ideas of what's possible down the line. Just look at those horrifically bright Miami Vice themed streets.</p><p>Feel free to get creative with Mapbox's tools to clarify the visual story you're trying to tell. I've distinguished points from others after adding a third data set: <strong>Every Starbucks in New York City.</strong> Yes, those map pins have been replaced with that terrifying Starbucks Logo Mermaid Sea-demon</p><p>Take a look at that perfect grid of mocha frappa-whatevers and tell me these guys don't have a business strategy:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://res-3.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/q_auto/v1/images/mapstarbucks2.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>God that's an ugly map.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>For all it's worth, I'd like to sincerely apologize for blinding your eyes with classless use of gifs paired with the useless corporate monstrosity of a map I've created. I have faith that you'll do better.</p><p>Now that we've spent enough time covering the n00b stuff, it's time to take the gloves off. While Mapbox studio's GUI serves as an amazing crutch and way to customize the look of our data, we must not forget: we're programmers, God damn it!
