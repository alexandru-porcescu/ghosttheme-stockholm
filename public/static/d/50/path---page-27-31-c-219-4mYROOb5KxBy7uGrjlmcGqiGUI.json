Remember, the IF statement allows the wielder to fork\nreality at their whim, to bend the code on a lark, to be the Franklin Richards\nof the spreadsheet just by asking the computer a simple true/false question.\nConsidering the gravity of this momentous revelation, I implore you to read the\nprevious statement in order to join us in enlightenment.\n\nAs we've already explored, all code, no matter how it's written, is built upon a\nfoundation of ones and zeros, sequenced an infinite number of ways to obtain an\ninfinite number of results, and the key to harnessing this power lies within the\nIF statement...kind of. Much like one can  write a sentence with two letters\n(GO!), or write an entire paragraph using the word \"buffalo\" doesn't necessarily\nmean that the next Nobel Prize in Literature is going to be won with the\ngroundbreaking poem GO BUFFALO! (or at least, I hope not). With that being said,\nwhile the IF statement is the foundation on which all code is built, it has\nfriends, in the form of OR and AND.\n\nTo put it simply, the IF statement checks to see if a given statement is true or\nfalse, but rarely do you want to merely check if one number is equal to another,\nsometimes you want to get a little bit more complex: enter the AND and OR\nstatements: the proverbial cherry and whip cream atop the Sunday.\n\nThe thing to always keep in mind is that everything always comes back to a\ntrue/false IF statement, the AND and OR statements only add more things to the\nmix for Excel to verify.\n\nLet's get one thing out of the way off the bat, while every programming language\ncontains IF, AND, and OR, the way you write out these statements (or perhaps,\nquestions?) in Excel's frontend (which is a fancy way to say \"the thing that you\nsee) is downright wacky. In the majority of programming languages, one would\nwrite an IF statement with an OR or an AND like you would a sentence:\n\n**IF the age of Jim > The age of Bob\nAND Bob is old\n(then)\n\"Print Jim is Old, older than Bob\"\n\nIn the vast majority of programming languages, you would write out that code\nalmost exactly as I wrote it (note that almost all programming languages imply\nthe \"then\"...including Excel). However, Excel likes to be different and forces\nyou to essentially write the same code in an ass backwards way, kind of like\nthis:\n\nIF(AND(Jim>Bob,Bob = old),\"Jim is old, older than bob\"\n\nYou'll notice right away that you'll need an AND before you write your IF\nstatement, which is kind of the opposite of how sentences (or even thinking in\ngeneral) works. On the plus side the way AND works in Excel is that it lets you\nkeep adding things to check after each comma, think of each comma within the AND\nstatement as adding another \"and\" to the sentence. In other words, you only need\nto write AND once for each IF you have.\n\nTo put things less esoterically, here are the nuts and bolts behind \"AND\":\n\nFirst you have the IF statement which checks to see if a given value is true or\nfalse. In the example above, its Jim's age. If you were checking Jim's age\nagainst Bob's age, and let's say Jim's age is written in cell A1 and Bob's age\nis written in cell B1, the IF would be written like this:\n\n**=IF(A1 > B1, \"Jim is old\", \"Jim is young\")\n\nBasically, you're seeing if Jim is older than Bob, and then you're given two\nchoices: If Jim is older than Bob, Jim is old, If Jim is not older than Bob, Jim\nis young. Naturally though, one's age is not measured in Bobs, and normally you\ncan't tell if any Jim off the street is old just by their proximity to a\nBob...so enter the AND.\n\nIn Excel, and is it's own formula (you can technically write =AND(1,2) and it'll\nreturn \"true\" because 1 and 2 are, in fact numbers) which checks to see if two\n(or more) arguments within it's parenthesis are true, and it'll return \"true\" if\nso. So, let's say You have Jim's age in cell A1, Bob's age in Cell B1, and the\nphrase \"this example is falling apart\" in cell C1, and Jim can only be\nconsidered \"old\" if this example is falling apart, you'd write it like this:\n\n**=IF(AND(A1>B1,C1= \"this example is falling apart\"),\"Jim is Old!\",\"Jim is not\nold!\")\n\nSo let's look at this from left to right in English: You're checking to see if\nJim is old (the IF statement), you know that Jim can only be considered old if\nhe is older than Bob (cell B1) AND  if this example is falling apart (C1), if\nall of these things are true, then Jim is, in fact, old, or else, he is not old.\n\nBefore we close out for the night, a quick PROTIP!: the ass-backwards way Excel\nforces you to write AND statements has an upside: you only need to write AND\nonce for each IF statement you include (and you better believe you can use more\nthan one...tune in next time!).

Sometimes we waste\nweeks of our lives thanks to an unreasonable and unknowledgeable stakeholder.\nOther times, we need to deal with XML trees.\n\nAt some point or another you're going to need to work with an API that returns\ninformation in XML format. \"Sure,\" we might think, \"I'll just import the\nstandard Python XML package, pick up some syntax nuances, and be on my way.\"\nThat's what I thought too. Today we're going to look at said library, the XML\nElementTree [https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html] \nlibrary, and see firsthand why this might not be the case.\n\nAs always, the purpose of this is to hopefully save somebody pain. Feel free to\nstash this in your back pocket until XML becomes a problem for you; I'm doing\nthe same.\n\nIt Can't be That Bad\nLet's tackle a few things upfront to save a couple hours of confusion.\n\nFirst off, you know how you've been dot notation to transverse object trees?\nYeah, we can't do that with XML. If we're looking for the child  of a parent, \nparent.child  simply does not work (no, parent['child'] doesn't work either). I\nhope you like looping through trees.\n\nPrint the value of an item in an XML tree doesn’t show you that item's value,\nnor does it show children of that item. It instead prints <Element\n'{http://www.example.com/servicemodel/resources}ItemName' at 0x7fadcf3f83b8>,\nwhich is like a Python equivalent of Javascript's [object Object] in terms of\nusefulness. We can use .text  to see the text value instead of an XML element;.\nGood luck on the other thing, though.\n\nGoing Green\nLet's get this over with and plant some XML trees. I'm going to assume we're\nworking from an API response here.\n\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n\ne = ET.fromstring(response.content)\n\n\nIf we were reading an XML file, we'd have to read the file and explicitly search\nfor the root.

You do you.\n\nIn Conclusion\nLook, XML just sucks: don't use it if you don't have to. If you do, save\nyourself some time by coming back to this page.","html":"<p>Life is filled with things we don't want to do; you're a developer so you probably understand this to a higher degree than most people. Sometimes we waste weeks of our lives thanks to an unreasonable and unknowledgeable stakeholder. Other times, we need to deal with XML trees.</p><p>At some point or another you're going to need to work with an API that returns information in XML format. \"Sure,\" we might think, \"I'll just import the standard Python XML package, pick up some syntax nuances, and be on my way.\" That's what I thought too. Today we're going to look at said library, the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html\">XML ElementTree</a> library, and see firsthand why this might not be the case.</p><p>As always, the purpose of this is to hopefully save somebody pain. Feel free to stash this in your back pocket until XML becomes a problem for you; I'm doing the same.</p><h2 id=\"it-can-t-be-that-bad\">It Can't be That Bad</h2><p>Let's tackle a few things upfront to save a couple hours of confusion.</p><p>First off, you know how you've been dot notation to transverse object trees? Yeah, we can't do that with XML. If we're looking for the <em>child</em> of a <em>parent</em>, <strong>parent.child</strong> simply does not work (no, parent['child'] doesn't work either). I hope you like looping through trees.</p><p>Print the value of an item in an XML tree doesn’t show you that item's value, nor does it show children of that item. It instead prints <code>&lt;Element '{http://www.example.com/servicemodel/resources}ItemName' at 0x7fadcf3f83b8&gt;</code>, which is like a Python equivalent of Javascript's [object Object] in terms of usefulness. We can use <strong>.text</strong> to see the text value instead of an XML element;. Good luck on the other thing, though.</p><h2 id=\"going-green\">Going Green</h2><p>Let's get this over with and plant some XML trees. I'm going to assume we're working from an API response here.</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n\ne = ET.fromstring(response.content)\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we were reading an XML file, we'd have to read the file and explicitly search for the root. Even though this doesn’t pertain to us, we should still be aware of this inconsistency to avoid future confusion:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">e = ET.parse('data.xml')\nroot = e.getroot()\n</code></pre>\n<p>When we loop through this tree, we 'll need to be mindful of the 3 ways we can interact with XML data. Let's use this tree as an example:</p><pre><code class=\"language-xml\">&lt;beer name=&quot;Bud Light&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;flavor&gt;Water&lt;/flavor&gt;\n    &lt;type&gt;Frat&lt;/type&gt;\n    &lt;rank&gt;0&lt;/rank&gt;\n&lt;/beer&gt;\n&lt;beer name=&quot;PBR&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;flavor&gt;Urine&lt;/flavor&gt;\n    &lt;type&gt;Ironic&lt;/type&gt;\n    &lt;rank&gt;1&lt;/rank&gt;\n&lt;/beer&gt;\n&lt;beer name=&quot;IPA&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;flavor&gt;Pretentious&lt;/flavor&gt;\n    &lt;type&gt;Hipster&lt;/type&gt;\n    &lt;rank&gt;2&lt;/rank&gt;\n&lt;/beer&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<ul><li><strong>item.tag</strong> returns the name of the tag.
