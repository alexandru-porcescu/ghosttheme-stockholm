Both frameworks have their place, with that “place” being in the realm of\npreference.\n\nWhy Flask?\nDeveloping apps in Flask has a much different narrative than when developing in\nmore traditional MVC Frameworks. In the past, the setup of a framework would\neasily take hours: with the assumption that our app needed all the bells and\nwhistles, it was impossible to get a “Hello world!” off the ground without a\nfull understanding of database configurations, static assets, templates, and\nother things our app may not even need. This is especially a concern for the\nPython ecosystem. Few people turn to Python for the sole purpose of building a\nweb app: the vast majority of Python developers are in the field of data\nanalysis without a traditional background in application development. Asking\ndata analysts (who have mostly become accustomed to Jupyter notebooks) to pick\nup all the fundamentals of web development before even getting started is just\nunrealistic.\n\nFlask's setup is merely a copy+paste of the following five lines:\n\nfrom flask import Flask\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef hello():\n    return \"Hello World!\"\n\n\nThose five lines create a live Flask application. Without any other knowledge\nabout the framework, we can immediately plug in any Python logic we already have\nto change “Hello world!” to match any output imaginable. While it's possible to\ncreate an entire Flask application as a single tiny file, Flask can be as\nextended to be just as powerful and complex as its predecessors. When the author\nof a Flask application deems it necessary, various Flask plugins can be pulled\nin to give us robust application logic. Examples include:\n\n * Flask-SQLAlchemy  for database interaction.\n * Flask-Sessions  for user session management.\n * Flask-Login  to manage user logins.\n * Literally hundreds [https://github.com/humiaozuzu/awesome-flask]  of other\n   libraries.\n\nThis plug-and-play structure makes Flask projects feel more expressive while\nsimultaneously providing simplicity to developers starting from 0. Not only\nthat, but reading somebody else’s source suddenly becomes simple: I know this\napp must do XYZ, because this person has imported XYZ.\n\nDissecting Flask’s “Hello World!”\nLet's go back to our 5-line application to pick apart the specifics:\n\nfrom flask import Flask \napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n\nThe most important part of the Flask Python library is Flask  with a capital “F”\n(as in: from flask import Flask).  This five-letter word creates an object which\nrefers to the entirety of the app itself: when we state app = Flask(__name__),\nwe are creating the variable app  which represents our application. Therefore,\nwhen we configure the variable app,  we’re configuring the way our entire\napplication works. For example, setting app = Flask()  can accept a few\nattributes:\n\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__,\n            instance_relative_config=False,\n            template_folder=\"templates\",\n            static_folder=\"static\"\n            )\n\n\nThis is an example of creating a Flask app with a few specifics: the location of\nour config file, the folder in which we'll store pages templates, and the folder\nin which we'll store frontend assets (JS, CSS, images, etc.).\n\nA Basic Flask Route\nThe primary function of our app is called hello(), which is importantly wrapped\nby Flask's most important decorator: .route(). If you aren't familiar with \ndecorators  in Python, a decorator is a function for us to wrap other functions\nwith. It isn't critically important to know all the details, other than that\nFlask comes with a route decorator which allows us to serve up functions based\non which page of the app the user is loading. By setting @app.route(\"/\"), we are\nspecifying that the function hello()  should fire whenever somebody uses our\napp.\n\nOf course, we can return any value besides \"Hello world!\" if we wanted. Let's\nsay you've already a script which returns the square of a number, plus 9. We\ncould save that logic in a function called squareOfNumberPlusNine(), in a file\ncalled logic.py. Now, our script can look like this:\n\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom logic import squareOfNumberPlusNine\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef hello():\n    value = squareOfNumberPlusNine(5)\n    return value\n\n\nThis would return 34  as opposed to \"Hello world!\". Without any prior knowledge\nof Python web development, we can already use Flask to plug into logic we've\nwritten and serve up a result.\n\nOther Parts of Flask's Core Library\nWe can import other things from flask  besides Flask. Here are some examples:\n\nServing Raw HTML\nMarkup  allows us to return an HTML page by rendering a string as HTML:\n\nfrom flask import Flask, Markup\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef hello():\n    return Markup(\"<h1>Hello World!</h1>\")\n\n\nServing an HTML Page Template\nreturn_template  will return an HTML page by finding the page in our /templates \nfolder:\n\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\napp = Flask(__name__, template_folder=\"templates\")\n\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef hello():\n    return render_template(\"index.html\")\n\n\nServing a JSON Response \nmake_response  is suitable if our application is an API and we'd like to return\na response object:\n\nfrom flask import Flask, make_response\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef hello():\n    headers = {\"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"}\n    return make_response('it worked!', 200, headers=headers)\n\n\nOn the topic of creating APIs with Flask, we can also specify whether the route\nat hand is a POST, GET, or some other method. This is handled easily within the\nroute decorator:\n\nfrom flask import Flask, make_response, request\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\"/\", methods=['GET'])\ndef hello():\n    if request.method != 'GET':\n        return make_response('Malformed request', 400)\n    headers = {\"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"}\n    return make_response('it worked!', 200, headers=headers)\n\n\nThe above function checks to make sure the user is accessing the endpoint with\nthe correct method first. If they've used the incorrect method, we return an\nerror.\n\nSuccumb to Flask\nEven if you chose to stick to your large Frameworks, it's easy to see why Flask\nis useful as a drop-in solution for many tasks. There are undoubtedly plenty of\nuseful Python scripts which go wasted because the final step of making them\neasily consumable by other people was never completed. Flask is an excellent way\nto achieve this last step, and the best part is: you already know how to use it.","html":"<p>Evidence of Flask’s rise to power has been all around us for a couple of years now.

For example, setting <code>app = Flask()</code> can accept a few attributes:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__,\n            instance_relative_config=False,\n            template_folder=&quot;templates&quot;,\n            static_folder=&quot;static&quot;\n            )\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is an example of creating a Flask app with a few specifics: the location of our config file, the folder in which we'll store pages templates, and the folder in which we'll store frontend assets (JS, CSS, images, etc.).</p><h3 id=\"a-basic-flask-route\">A Basic Flask Route</h3><p>The primary function of our app is called <code>hello()</code>, which is importantly wrapped by Flask's most important decorator: <code>.route()</code>. If you aren't familiar with <strong>decorators</strong> in Python, a decorator is a function for us to wrap other functions with. It isn't critically important to know all the details, other than that Flask comes with a route decorator which allows us to serve up functions based on which page of the app the user is loading. By setting <code>@app.route(\"/\")</code>, we are specifying that the function <code>hello()</code> should fire whenever somebody uses our app.</p><p>Of course, we can return any value besides \"Hello world!\" if we wanted. Let's say you've already a script which returns the square of a number, plus 9. We could save that logic in a function called <code>squareOfNumberPlusNine()</code>, in a file called <code>logic.py</code>. Now, our script can look like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Flask\nfrom logic import squareOfNumberPlusNine\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(&quot;/&quot;)\ndef hello():\n    value = squareOfNumberPlusNine(5)\n    return value\n</code></pre>\n<p>This would return <strong>34</strong> as opposed to \"<strong>Hello world!\"</strong>. Without any prior knowledge of Python web development, we can already use Flask to plug into logic we've written and serve up a result.</p><h2 id=\"other-parts-of-flask-s-core-library\">Other Parts of Flask's Core Library</h2><p>We can import other things <code>from flask</code> besides <code>Flask</code>. Here are some examples:</p><h3 id=\"serving-raw-html\">Serving Raw HTML</h3><p><code>Markup</code> allows us to return an HTML page by rendering a string as HTML:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Flask, Markup\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(&quot;/&quot;)\ndef hello():\n    return Markup(&quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"serving-an-html-page-template\">Serving an HTML Page Template</h3><p><code>return_template</code> will return an HTML page by finding the page in our <code>/templates</code> folder:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Flask, render_template\napp = Flask(__name__, template_folder=&quot;templates&quot;)\n\n@app.route(&quot;/&quot;)\ndef hello():\n    return render_template(&quot;index.html&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"serving-a-json-response\">Serving a JSON Response </h3><p><code>make_response</code> is suitable if our application is an API and we'd like to return a response object:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Flask, make_response\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(&quot;/&quot;)\ndef hello():\n    headers = {&quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;}\n    return make_response('it worked!', 200, headers=headers)\n</code></pre>\n<p>On the topic of creating APIs with Flask, we can also specify whether the route at hand is a POST, GET, or some other method. This is handled easily within the route decorator:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Flask, make_response, request\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(&quot;/&quot;, methods=['GET'])\ndef hello():\n    if request.method != 'GET':\n        return make_response('Malformed request', 400)\n    headers = {&quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;}\n    return make_response('it worked!', 200, headers=headers)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above function checks to make sure the user is accessing the endpoint with the correct method first. If they've used the incorrect method, we return an error.</p><h2 id=\"succumb-to-flask\">Succumb to Flask</h2><p>Even if you chose to stick to your large Frameworks, it's easy to see why Flask is useful as a drop-in solution for many tasks. There are undoubtedly plenty of useful Python scripts which go wasted because the final step of making them easily consumable by other people was never completed. Flask is an excellent way to achieve this last step, and the best part is: you already know how to use it.</p>","url":"https://hackersandslackers.com/creating-your-first-flask-application/","uuid":"dac63aa8-2a5d-4d3e-a6b1-cccc5785764c","page":false,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"comment_id":"5b426ec02d99b9040e300f74"}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c12d7bfe875ad7bb867369d","title":"Extract Massive Amounts of Data from APIs in Python","slug":"extracting-massive-datasets-from-apis","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://hackersandslackers.com/content/images/2018/07/usa@2x.jpg","excerpt":"Abusing REST APIs for all they’re worth.","custom_excerpt":"Abusing REST APIs for all they’re worth.","created_at_pretty":"04 July, 2018","published_at_pretty":"04 July, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"28 March, 2019","created_at":"2018-07-04T15:24:18.000-04:00","published_at":"2018-07-04T17:26:00.000-04:00","updated_at":"2019-03-28T07:55:05.000-04:00","meta_title":"Extracting Massive Datasets in Python | Hackers and Slackers","meta_description":"The data we need and crave is stashed behind APIs all around us.

Iterating through DB output by hand?\nRemembering which function is the actual one that matches the Python data\nstructure you're gonna be using?\n\nThere has to be a better way!\n\nThere totally is.\n\nOne of Pandas' most useful abilities is easy I/O. Whether it's a CSV, JSON, an\nExcel file, or a database - Pandas gets you what you want painlessly. In\nfact,I'd say that even if you don't have the spare bandwidth at the moment to\nrewire your brain to learn all the wonderful ways Pandas lets you manipulate\ndata (array-based programming generally isn't the first paradigm people learn),\nthen it's STILL worth using just for the I/O. Grab your data with one of its\ndelicious one-liners, and once it's in a Dataframe there's have a method to\nconvert it to practically any combination of native Python data structures that\nyou want (lists of lists? Lists of dictionaries? Lots of other stuff?  You've\ngot it!).\n\nHere we'll be looking at interacting with a database with Pandas, because that's\nwhat I was finishing up when I saw Todd texted me that a lot of the people who\nwind up on the site are searching for Pandas stuff.\n\nSo, for our purposes, let's say you're doing Python stuff with a MySQL database.\nI'm also assuming you're using Linux (including via Windows Subsystem for Linux,\nwhich is what I use in order to have Ubuntu on my Windows laptop), because I've\nnever done this with Windows.\n\nAnnoyingly, there's more than one potential connector - I generally use PyMySQL,\nfor no particular reason. Installing this involves an extra step - telling pip\nor Conda to install it won't do the whole thing. Annoying, but them's the\nbreaks.\n\nsudo apt-get install python3-pymysql -y\n\n\nShould get you there. I remember fussing with this every time I have to do it on\na new machine.\n\nYou also have to install a mysql-connector, for reasons I won't pretend to\nunderstand.\n\nconda install mysql-connector-python -y\n\n\nI've never actually done this with pip, but I assume it'd be\n\npip install mysql-connector\n\n\nIf that doesn't work, try\n\npip install --allow-external mysql-connector-python mysql-connector-python\n\n\nWE'RE ALMOST DONE INSTALLING THINGS!\nLast, but not least, is a lovely little thing called SQLAlchemy. Remember when I\nsaid I didn't actually know anything about PyMySQL and its relative advantages\nand disadvantages to other MySQL connectors for Python? Part of the reason for\nthat is that SQLAlchemy, as the name implies, allows you to MAGICALLY wrap\nPython SQL connectors at a higher level of abstraction and not have to deal with\nthe particulars. So, grab a little chunk of Philosopher's Stone, and - oh, it's\nactually a default Anaconda package. BUT, if you're in a fresh environment (or\nnot using Conda)...\n\n(Always remember the little -y   at the end. That ensures that you can walk away\nwhile it installs and it'll be done when you get back, instead of finishing the\nlong process of whatever's happening when you first tell it to install and then\nwaiting to start on the next long process that takes place after you hit y.)\n\nOR\n\npip install sqlalchemy   (that IS one of the nice things about pip! Doesn't need\nyou to confirm).\n\nSo, to review, before we start Pythoning...\n\n$ sudo apt-get install python3-pymysql -y\n$ conda install mysql-connector-python -y\n$ conda install -c anaconda sqlalchemy -y\n\n\nOR\n\n$ sudo apt-get install python3-pymysql -y\n$ pip install mysql-connector\n$ pip install sqlalchemy\n\n\nCool! Ready to learn about SQLAlchemy? Well, you won't - this is about Pandas!\n We're going YET ANOTHER LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION HIGHER. SQLAlchemy is just what\nPandas uses to connect to databases.\n\nAaaand one (possible) last step. If you're doing this with a locally-installed\ndb, you might have to sudo service mysql start.\n\n(Like, every time you do dev work on it. At least on my machine. Your mileage\nmay vary)\n\nOn to the Actual Python\nSo, what does all this do for us? Well, first off, it wasn't THAT much - and you\nonly have to do it once (per machine (really per environment per machine (you\nare  taking advantage of Conda envs or virtualenvs, right?))). But what it\nreally lets us skip all the implementation  details and focus on the actual\nlogic of what we're doing. That's really what both SQL and Pandas are all about-\nthey wed short, declarative  bits of code to highly optimized libraries\nunderneath the hood. Relational Database Management Systems sit on top of code\nthat's been optimized for decades, turning your short queries into highly\nefficient compiled code. Pandas takes advantage of scientific computing\nlibraries for doing matrix operations that have been around since before there\nwas an internet. Drill down deep enough in Pandas and you'll actually find\nFORTRAN code that was originally written to simulate nuclear explosions. Our\nwhole goal is to just focus on our data manipulation via SQL and Python's\nscientific computing family - and we don't want to add a bunch of additional\ncognitive load from worrying about cursors.\n\nOkay, I Lied - NOW on to the Actual Python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport pymysql\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\n\n\nFrom all the database connector stuff we installed, we actually just need ONE\nfunction - and then it's pure blissful operations on data from here on out.\ncreate_engine()  will create a connection for us, and then we'll use that as an\nargument to Pandas functions that talk to the DB. You might have to reopen it\nsometimes. Whatever.\n\nFirst, let's make a string that describes our database. Note that normally you\nshouldn't actually store this directly in your code (IT will totally be mad at\nyou), but for our purposes let's include it.\n\nThe format is:\n\ndialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database\n\n\nSo, since we're using mysql, and the PyMySQL package, we'd start with:\n\nmysql+pymysql://username:password@host:port/database\n\n\nThe rest is fairly straightforward. So, if we've got the user \"analyst\"  with\nthe password \"badsecuritykills\" with a local MySQL running on port 3306 (pretty\nsure you don't have to specify a port if it's localhost, but bear with me), and\nthe database itself is named terrible_purchases, it'd be:\n\nmysql+pymysql://analyst:badsecuritykills@localhost:3306/terrible_purchases\n\n\nAnd now let's actually make our connection!\n\ncnx = create_engine('mysql+pymysql://analyst:badsecuritykills@localhost:3306/terrible_purchases)\n\n\nDone! Now Pandas can read and write from our database.\nIf you don't wanna have to see a whole bunch of extraneous stuff, I'd also add\nthe flag echo=False  (create_engine  has a ton of useful little flags, letting\nyou do stuff like automatically strip unicode that your database might not be\nable to read).\nBehold! We can write an SQL query and then get a Pandas Dataframe with those\nexact parameters. We can rapidly prototype without worrying that the reason our\nquery isn't working is that we forgot some fussy intermediary stage. We can get\nstuff wrong and experiment!\n\nReading a table is easy as:\n\ndf = pd.io.sql.sql_query(\"SELECT * FROM cursed_items\", cnx)\n\n\nDone in one line!\n\nWriting is just as easy (with a teeeensy little asterisk, that I'll probably\ntalk about in the future). Let's say we dusted off an old CSV with more cursed\nitems that aren't in our database. After we've loaded it (and maybe done some\ncleaning)\n\nnewCursedItemsDF.to_sql(name='cursed_items', con=cnx, if_exists='append')\n\n\nThe if_exists  flag adds a ton of flexibility. You can create a whole new DB\ntable from a Dataframe, and that's actually the default behavior. For our case,\nwe appended - but there's other times when we might want to replace, for\ninstance.\n\nFinal Addendum\nSo, this is a super useful workflow for doing interactive analytics work with\nstuff that's on a database. It's also quite useful for quick-and-dirty scripts,\nor for prototyping the logic of something that'll be expanded upon later.  And,\nah, bigger stuff too - especially if there's gonna be really complex\ntransformations that. As long as the data can fit in memory (RAM), Pandas is\npretty awesome.\n\n\nThat being said, there are  times when you'd actually want to deal with the\nlevels we bypassed here. Everything has tradeoffs. One example would be that all\nthose compiled Linear Algebra libraries that Pandas sit on top of have a massive\nmemory footprint, and AWS Lambda charges you according to memory usage. I'm\npretty sure there are also use cases where this method of handling the\nlower-level nitty-gritty of database interactions (ie, by mostly not  handling\nit) will cause problems. But at that point, we're dealing with the difference\nbetween Data Science & Data Engineering.","html":"<p>Manually opening and closing cursors? Iterating through DB output by hand?
