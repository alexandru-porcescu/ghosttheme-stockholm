Like most major\nPython libraries, SQLAlchemy has been ported into a version specifically\ncompatible with Flask, aptly named Flask-SQLAlchemy.\n\nSimilar to the core SQLAlchemy package, Flask-SQLAlchemy provides an ORM for us\nto modify application data by easily creating defined models. Regardless of what\nyour database of choice might be, Flask-SQLAlchemy will ensure that the models\nwe create in Python will translate to the syntax of our chosen database. Given\nthe ease-of-use and one-size-fits-all  nature of Flask-SQLAlchemy, it's no\nwonder that the library has been the de facto database library of choice for\nFlask since the very beginning (seriously, is there even another option?)\n\nConfiguring Flask-SQLAlchemy For Your Application\nThere are a few essential configuration variables we need to set upfront before\ninteracting with our database. As is standard, we'll be using a class defined in\n config.py  to handle our Flask config:\n\nimport os\n\n\nclass Config:\n    \"\"\"Set Flask configuration vars from .env file.\"\"\"\n    \n    # General\n    TESTING = os.environ[\"TESTING\"]\n    FLASK_DEBUG = os.environ[\"FLASK_DEBUG\"]\n\n    # Database\n    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get(\"SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI\")\n    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = os.environ.get(\"SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS\")\n\n\nLet's break these down:\n\n * SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI: the connection string we need to connect to our\n   database. This follows the standard convention: \n   [db_type]+[db_connector]://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[db_name]\n * SQLALCHEMY_ECHO: When set to 'True', Flask-SQLAlchemy will log all database\n   activity to Python's stderr for debugging purposes.\n * SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS: Honestly, I just always set this to 'False,'\n   otherwise an obnoxious warning appears every time you run your app reminding\n   you that this option takes a lot of system resources.\n\nThose are the big ones we should worry about. If you're into some next-level\ndatabase shit, there are a few other pro-mode configuration variables which you\ncan find here [http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.3/config/].\n\nBy using the exact naming conventions for the variables above, simply having\nthem in our config file will automatically configure our database connections\nfor us. We will never have to create engines, sessions, or connections.\nInitiating Flask-SQLAlchemy With Our App\nAs always, we're going to use the Flask Application Factory method\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/structuring-your-flask-app/]  for initiating our\napp. If you're unfamiliar with the term, you're going to find this tutorial to\nbe confusing and pretty much useless.\n\nThe most basic __init__.py  file for Flask applications using Flask-SQLAlchemy\nshould look like this:\n\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n\ndb = SQLAlchemy()\n\n\ndef create_app():\n    \"\"\"Construct the core application.\"\"\"\n    app = Flask(__name__, instance_relative_config=False)\n    db.init_app(app)\n    app.config.from_object('config.Config')\n\n    with app.app_context():\n        # Imports\n        from . import routes\n        \n        # Create tables for our models\n        db.create_all()\n\n        return app\n\n\nNote the presence of db  and its location: this our database object being set as\na global  variable outside of create_app(). Inside of create_app(), on the other\nhand, contains the line db.init_app(app). Even though we've set our db object\nglobally, this means nothing until we initialize it after creating our\napplication. We accomplish this by calling init_app()  within create_app(), and\npassing our app as the parameter. Within the actual 'application context' is\nwhere we'll call create_all(), which we'll cover in a bit.\n\nIf that last paragraph sounded like total gibberish to you, you are not alone. \nThe Flask Application Factory is perhaps one of the most odd and poorly\nexplained concepts in Python software development- my best advice is to not\nbecome frustrated, take the copy + paste code above, and blindly accept the\nspoon-fed nonsense enough times until it becomes second nature. That's what I\ndid, and even as I worked through this tutorial, I still  came across obnoxious\nquirks that caught me off-guard.\n\nTake note of import we make inside of the application context called routes.\nThis is one of two files we haven't written just yet: once we create them, our\napplication file structure will look something like this:\n\nmy-app\n├── /application\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── routes.py\n│   ├── models.py\n├── .env\n├── config.py\n└── wsgi.py\n\n\nCreating Database Models\nCreate a models.py  file in our application directory. Here we'll import the db \nobject that we created in __init__.py. Now we can create database models by\ndefining classes in this file.\n\nA common example would be to start with a User  model. The first variable we\ncreate is __tablename__, which will correspond to the name of the SQL table new\nusers will be saved. Each additional variable we create within this model class\nwill correspond a column in the database:\n\nfrom . import db\n\n\nclass User(db.Model):\n    \"\"\"Model for user accounts.\"\"\"\n\n    __tablename__ = 'users'\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer,\n                   primary_key=True\n                   )\n    username = db.Column(db.String(64),\n                         index=False,\n                         unique=True,\n                         nullable=False\n                         )\n    email = db.Column(db.String(80),\n                      index=True,\n                      unique=True,\n                      nullable=False\n                      )\n    created = db.Column(db.DateTime,\n                        index=False,\n                        unique=False,\n                        nullable=False\n                        )\n    bio = db.Column(db.Text,\n                    index=False,\n                    unique=False,\n                    nullable=True\n                    )\n    admin = db.Column(db.Boolean,\n                      index=False,\n                      unique=False,\n                      nullable=False\n                      )\n    \n    def __repr__(self):\n        return '<User {}>'.format(self.username)\n\n\nEach \"column\" accepts the following attributes:\n\n * Data Type:  Accepts one of the following: String(size), Text, DateTime, Float\n   , Boolean, PickleType, or LargeBinary.\n * primary_key: Whether or not the column should serve as the primary key.\n * unique: Whether or not to enforce unique values for the column.\n * nullable: Denotes required fields.\n\nWith our first model created, you're already way closer to interacting with your\ndatabase than you might think.\n\nCreating Our First Entry\nLet's create a user in our routes.py  file.\n\nfrom flask import request, render_template, make_response\nfrom datetime import datetime as dt\nfrom flask import current_app as app\nfrom .models import db, User\n\n\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])\ndef entry():\n    \"\"\"Endpoint to create a user.\"\"\"\n    new_user = User(username='myuser',\n                    email='myuser@example.com',\n                    created=dt.now(),\n                    bio=\"In West Philadelphia born and raised, on the playground is where I spent most of my days\",\n                    admin=False\n                    )\n    db.session.add(new_user)\n    db.session.commit()\n    return make_response(\"User created!\")\n\n\nCheck out how easy this is! All it takes to create a user is create an instance\nof the User  class from models.py, add it to our session via \ndb.session.add(new_user), and commit the changes with db.session.commit()! Let's\nsee what happens when we run this app:\n\nUser Created!\n\n\nThat's what we like to see! If we access our database at this point, we can see\nthat this exact record was created in our users  table.\n\nQuerying Our New Data\nCreating information is dope, but how can we confirm it exists? I've added a few\nthings to routes.py  to show us what's up:\n\nfrom flask import request, render_template\nfrom datetime import datetime as dt\nfrom flask import current_app as app\nfrom .models import db, User\n\n\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])\ndef entry():\n    \"\"\"Endpoint to create a user.\"\"\"\n    new_user = User(username='myuser',\n                    email='myuser@example.com',\n                    created=dt.now(),\n                    bio=\"In West Philadelphia born and raised, on the playground is where I spent most of my days\",\n                    admin=False\n                    )\n    db.session.add(new_user)\n    db.session.commit()\n    users = User.query.all()\n    return render_template('users.html', users=users, title=\"Show Users\")\n\n\n  The statement User.query.all()  will return all instances of User  in our\ndatabase. I created a Jinja template to show us all records nicely:\n\n{% extends \"layout.html\" %}\n\n{% block content %}\n  {% for user in users %}\n    <ul id=\"user.username\">\n      <li>Username: {{ user.username }}</li>\n      <li>Email: {{ user.email }}</li>\n      <li>Created: {{ user.created }}</li>\n      <li>Bio: {{ user.bio }}</li>\n      <li>Admin: {{ user.admin }}</li>\n    </ul>\n  {% endfor %}\n{% endblock %}\n\n\nThus, our app gives us:\n\nWe have liftoff!So we can get a single user, but what about a whole table full\nof users? Well, all we need to do is keep changing the username and email\naddress (our unique keys, to avoid a clash) when firing up the app, and each\ntime it runs, it'll create a new user. Here's what comes back after running the\napp a few times with different values:\n\nI Can't Believe It's Not Error Messages.™Here, Take All My Stuff\nSure, Flask-SQLAlchemy is great once you get going, but as we've already seen\n\"getting set up\" isn't always a walk in the park. This is one of those things\nthat always seems to be wrong no matter how many times you've done it from\nmemory.\n\nAs a parting gift, I've put the source for this tutorial up on Github\n[https://github.com/toddbirchard/flasksqlalchemy-tutorial]  for you to treasure\nand enjoy. No seriously, take it. Get it away from me. I'm done with Flask for\ntoday.

The statement clearly states\nwhat status-quo developers have feared for months: if you haven't shifted from\nREST to GraphQL by now, you are officially recognized by the international\ncommunity to hold \"uncool\" status. A humanitarian crisis is already unfolding as\nrefugees of coolness are threatening to overtake borders, sparking fears of an\ninflux of Thinkpad Laptops, IntelliJ, and other Class A  uncool narcotics.\n\nHold up: is GraphQL That Dramatic of an Improvement over REST?\nIn all honesty, I've found that the only way to properly answer this question is\nto first utter \"kinda,\" then mull back and forth for a little while, and then\nfinishing with a weak statement like \"so pretty much, yeah.\"\n\nLet’s put it this way. When you’re first familiarizing yourself with a set of\ndata, what do you do? Do you read extensive documentation about the SQL table\nyou’re about to check out? Do you read the entire spec for your version\nPostgreSQL to see if it contains the functionality that might be missing for\nsome reason? I’m going to guess you do neither of these- chances are you just\nlook at the data. \n\nUsing any REST API is inherently a context-switch. No matter how many APIs\nyou’ve worked with in the past, you’ll never be able to know a new API’s\nendpoints, quirks, or the awful manner in which the creator has abandoned any\ndistinction between GET, POST, or PUT methods altogether. GraphQL is not\nnecessarily more technologically impressive than REST, but it does  provide us a\nsyntax and workflow comparable to working directly with databases with which\nwe're already familiar.\n\nRemember when us young guys justified replacing older devs when we came out of\nthe gate with NodeJS, arguing that context-switching changes everything? GraphQL\nis just that: a \"better\" technology with less mental context-switching, which\nconveniently serves a double-purpose for enterprises looking to fire anybody\nthey perceive to be dead weight over the age of 30. Good luck finding a better\nsynopsis than that.\n\nWhat’s this Prisma Nonsense? \nPrisma [https://www.prisma.io/]  is a free (FREE!) service that provides with\nthe tools to create an API client, as well as an Admin panel to manage it.\nWithout any prior knowledge of GraphQL needed, Prisma provides us with:\n\n * A CLI which’s stand up a web server which will serve as our API: either cloud\n   or self-hosted.\n * Automatic integration with your database of choice (including cloud DBs, such\n   as RDS).\n * A clever obfuscation of data models via a simple config file. No classes, no\n   code, no bullshit.\n * A \"playground\" interface which allows us to mess around in GraphQL syntax\n   against our models without breaking everything.\n * A web GUI which displays the relationships between all of these things and\n   their usage.\n\nIn short, Prisma does our jobs for us. Now that tasks associated with building\nAPIs, creating ORMs, and managing databases have all been trivialized, we can\nfinally cut some more of that dead weight we mentioned earlier- specifically\nBob, the asshole coming up on his 35th birthday sitting on his high-horse just\nbecause he has an obligation to feed 3 beautiful children. Sorry Bob, it just\nwasn't working out.\n\nPrisma does  provide the option to set up a test environment on their cloud, but\nlet's do something useful with our lives for once and build something\nproduction-ready. In this case, that means standing up a 5-dollar Digital Ocean\nDroplet.\n\nCreate a Prisma Account\nGet over to the sexually appealing Prisma Cloud landing page\n[https://www.prisma.io/cloud]  and make yourself an account. When prompted, make\nsure you select Deploy a new Prisma Service.\n\nExample services are for sissys.You should then be prompted with the following\nscreen. It will instruct you to install an NPM package, but there are a few\nthings we need to do first.\n\nWhen she says \"waiting for login,\" she means \"I'd wait a lifetime for you, my\nlove.\"Installing Prisma Dependencies on a Fresh VPS\nSSH into whichever VPS you've chosen. I'll be using a Ubuntu instance for this\ntutorial. If you happen to be using Ubuntu as well, feel free to copy + paste\nall the stuff I'm sure you've done a million times already. First, we need to\ninstall Node:\n\n$ apt update\n$ apt upgrade -y\n$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -\n$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n$ sudo apt-get install gcc g++ make\n$ sudo npm install -g npm@latest\n\n\nBefore you do anything crazy like copy & paste those two lines from Prisma,\nyou're going to need to set up Docker a few steps later, so you might as well do\nthat now: \n\n1. Install Docker Dependencies\n$ sudo apt-get install \\\n    apt-transport-https \\\n    ca-certificates \\\n    curl \\\n    gnupg-agent \\\n    software-properties-common\n\n\n2. Add Docker Key\n$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -\n$ sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88\n\n\n3. Get Docker Repository\n$ sudo add-apt-repository \\\n   \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\\n   $(lsb_release -cs) \\\n   stable\"\n\n\n4. Finally Install Docker\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io\n\n\nGood job, you're doing great.\n\nInstall & Activate The Prisma CLI\nCool, now we can carry on with Prisma's demands. Install the Prisma CLI\nglobally, and then use said CLI to log in to Prisma.\n\n$ npm install -g prisma\n$ prisma login -k eyJhbGciGYU78tfuyLALALTHISKEYISFAKELOL69KFGs\n\n\nWait a couple of seconds after entering the login prompt, and you'll notice your\nbrowser window will have changed to indicate that you're now logged in. \n\nThe next step will create the local files which serve as the heart and soul of\nour API. Make sure you init Prisma  in whichever directory you like to keep\nthings in:\n\n$ cd /my/desired/directory/\n$ prisma init my-prisma\n\n\nInitiating the project will kickstart a quick and painless interrogation\nprocess. Keep in mind that it's recommended to use Prisma with a fresh database\ninstance; in my case, I spun up a cloud PostgreSQL instance.\n\n? Set up a new Prisma server or deploy to an existing server? Use existing database\n? What kind of database do you want to deploy to?:\n? Does your database contain existing data?:\n? Enter database host:\n? Enter database port:\n? Enter database user:\n? Enter database password: \n? Enter database name (the database includes the schema):\n? Use SSL?:\n\n\nCompleting this will result in the following structure:\n\nmy-prisma\n├── datamodel.prisma\n├── docker-compose.yml\n├── generated\n│   └── prisma-client\n│       ├── index.ts\n│       └── prisma-schema.ts\n└── prisma.yml\n\n\nWe're almost there cowboy and/or cowgirl. \n\nSet Phasers to \"Deploy\"\nPrisma is going to stand itself up on port 4466, which is closed by default on\nmost servers. Make sure you have this port open:\n\n$ ufw allow 4466\n\n\nFinally, we need to set a secret  in order to connect to Prisma cloud. Open the \ndocker-compose.yml  file and uncomment the managementApiSecret  line. Replace\nthe value with some sort of deep dark personal secret of yours.\n\n$ vim docker-compose.yml\n\n\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n  prisma:\n    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.25\n    restart: always\n    ports:\n    - \"4466:4466\"\n    environment:\n      PRISMA_CONFIG: |\n        port: 4466\n        # uncomment the next line and provide the env var \n        managementApiSecret: my-secret\n        databases:\n          default:\n            connector: postgres\n            host: 123.45.678.90\n            database: databasename\n            user: username\n            password: password\n            rawAccess: true\n            port: '5432'\n            migrations: true\n\n\n\nFor some reason, Prisma does not automatically specify your SSL preferences in\ndocker-compose, even if you explicity answer \"yes\" to the SSL prompt. If your\ndatabase requires SSL, be sure to add ssl: true  to the end of your\ndocker-compose config. Otherwise, your deployment will fail.As per the comment\nin our yml  file, we need to export the secret we specify with \nmanagementApiSecret: my-secret  as an environment variable. Back in your Prisma\ndirectory, export your secret as such:\n\n$ export PRISMA_MANAGEMENT_API_SECRET=my-secret\n\n\nThis secret is used to generate a token to secure our endpoint. Skipping this\nstep would result in exposing your database to the world with full read/write\naccess to anybody.\n\nIt's Game Time\nIt's time to deploy, baby! Do it, push the button! DO IT NOW!\n\n$ docker-compose up -d\n$ prisma deploy\n\n\nDeploying for the first time does a few things. It'll stand up a 'playground'\ninterface on your local server (localhost:4466), as well as automatically get\nyou set up with Prisma Cloud, which is essentially an admin interface for your\ndeployment hosted on Prisma's site.\n\nCheck Out Your Workspace \nVisit [Your Server's IP]:4466 to see what you've done:\n\nA playground for children of all agesCheck it out! Along with documentation of\nthe generic data models Prisma shipped with, you can test queries or mutations\non the left side of the UI, and receive responses on the right. Sure beats\nPostman imho.\n\nDon't Look Down: You're in the Cloud\nYou can now add your server to Prisma Cloud to get the benefits of their admin\npanel. From here, you can modify information directly, review usage metrics, and\nmanage multiple instances:\n\nBreaking News: Prisma is Too Cool For School.Working With Prisma And GraphQL\nNow that we've spun up this shiny new toy, let's be sure we know how to drive\nit.\n\nOn your VPS, take a look at the datamodels.prisma  file:\n\n$ vim datamodels.prisma\n\n\nYou should see a data model called User (everybody has this model). To add or\nmodify data models, all we need to do is change the fields as we see fit, set\ntheir data type, and specify whether or not we'd like the field to be unique.\nBelow I've added a couple of new 'fields.'\n\ntype User {\n  id: ID! @unique\n  name: String!\n  email: String! @unique\n  gravatar: String!\n}\n\n\nDeploying Prisma again with these changes will modify our database's table\nstructure to match the new model:\n\n$ prisma deploy\n\n\nThere you have it: one more buzzword to put your resum\u001d\u001de. In fact, feel free to\ncompletely falsify the existence of a GraphQL certification and throw that on\nthere, too. If you're the kind of person who enjoys reading technical posts like\nthis in your free time, chances are you're already qualified for the job.

With most enterprises comfortably settled into their Apache-based Big\nData stacks, BigQuery rattles the cages of convention for many. Luckily, Hackers\nAnd Slackers is no such enterprise. Thus, we aren't afraid to ask the Big\nquestion: how much easier would life be with BigQuery?\n\nBig Data, BigQuery\nIn short, BigQuery trivializes the act of querying against multiple,\nunpredictable data sources. To better understand when this is useful, it would\nbetter serve us to identify the types of questions BigQuery can answer. Such as:\n\n * What are our users doing across our multiple systems? How do we leverage log\n   files outputted by multiple systems to find out?\n * How can we consolidate information about employee information, payroll, and\n   benefits, when these all live in isolated systems?\n * What the hell am I supposed to do with all these spreadsheets?\n\nUnlike previous solutions, BigQuery solves these problems in a single product\nand does so with SQL-like query syntax,  a web interface, and 7 native Client\nLibraries.  There are plenty of reasons to love BigQuery, but let's start with\none we've recently already talked about: the auto-generation of table schemas. \n\nMatt has demonstrated how to approach this problem manually with the help of\nPandas\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/downcast-numerical-columns-python-pandas/]. I\nprovided a more gimmicky approach by leveraging the Python table-schema library\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/infer-datatypes-from-csvs-to-create/]. With\nBigQuery, we find yet another alternative which is neither manual or gimmicky:\nperfect for those who are lazy, rich, and demand perfection (AKA: your clients,\nprobably).\n\nFirst, we'll need to get our data into BigQuery\n\nUploading Data into Google Cloud Storage via the Python SDK\nBigQuery requires us to go through Google Cloud Storage as a buffer before\ninputting data into tables. No big deal, we'll write a script!\n\nWe're assuming that you have a basic knowledge of Google Cloud, Google Cloud\nStorage, and how to download a JSON Service Account key\n[https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries]  to store locally\n(hint: click the link).\n\nfrom google.cloud import storage\n\nbucket_uri = 'gs://your-bucket/'\nbucket_name = 'your-bucket'\nbucket_target = 'datasets/data_upload.csv'\nlocal_dataset = 'data/test.csv'\n\n\ndef upload_blob(bucket_name, source_file_name, destination_blob_name):\n    \"\"\"Upload a CSV to Google Cloud Storage.\n\n    1. Retrieve the target bucket.\n    2. Set destination of data to be uploaded.\n    3. Upload local CSV.\n    \"\"\"\n    storage_client = storage.Client()\n    bucket = storage_client.get_bucket(bucket_name)\n    blob = bucket.blob(destination_blob_name)\n    # Commence Upload\n    blob.upload_from_filename(source_file_name)\n    print('File {} uploaded to {}.'.format(\n        source_file_name,\n        destination_blob_name))\n        \n        \nupload_blob(bucket_name, local_dataset, bucket_target)\n\n\nThe above is nearly a copy + paste of Google Cloud's sample code for the Google\nCloud Storage Python SDK:\n\n * bucket_uri  is found by inspecting any bucket's information on Google Cloud.\n * bucket_name  is... well, you know.\n * bucket_target  represents the resulting file structure representing the saved\n   CSV when completed.\n * local_dataset  is the path to a CSV we've stored locally: we can assume that\n   we've grabbed some data from somewhere, like an API, and tossed into a local\n   file temporarily.\n\nSuccessfully executing the above results in the following message:\n\nFile data/test.csv uploaded to datasets/data_upload.csv.\n\n\nInserting Data from Cloud Storage to BigQuery\nThat was the easy part. Let's move on to the good stuff:\n\nfrom google.cloud import storage\nfrom google.cloud import bigquery\n\nbucket_uri = 'gs://your-bucket/'\nbucket_name = 'your-bucket'\nbucket_target = 'datasets/data_upload.csv'\nlocal_dataset = 'data/test.csv'\nbucket_target_uri = bucket_uri + bucket_target\nbigquery_dataset = 'uploadtest'\nbigquery_table = 'my_table'\n\n\ndef upload_blob(bucket_name, source_file_name, destination_blob_name):\n    \"\"\"Upload a CSV to Google Cloud Storage.\n\n    1. Retrieve the target bucket.\n    2. Set destination of data to be uploaded.\n    3.

Specify the source format of the file (defaults to CSV).\n    6. Pass the URI of the data storage on Google Cloud Storage from.\n    7. Load BigQuery Job.\n    8.

In BigQuery, tables can\nbelong to a 'dataset,' which is a grouping of tables. Compare this concept to\nMongoDB's collections, or PostgreSQL's schemas. Note that this process is made\nmuch easier by the fact that we stored our project key locally: otherwise, we'd\nhave to specify which Google Cloud project we're looking for, etc.\n\nWith the dataset specified, we begin to build our \"job\" object with \nLoadJobConfig. This is like loading a gun before unleashing a shotgun blast into\nthe face of our problems. Alternatively, a more relevant comparison could be\nwith the Python requests  library and the act of prepping an API request before\nexecution.\n\nWe set job_config.autodetect  to be True, obviously. \njob_config.skip_leading_rows  reserves our header row from screwing things up.\n\nload_job  puts our request together, and load_job.result()  executes said job.\nThe .result()  method graciously puts the rest of our script on hold until the\nspecified job is completed. In our case, we want this happen: it simplifies our\nscript so that we don't need to verify this manually before moving on.\n\nLet's see what running that job with our fake data looks like in the BigQuery\nUI:\n\nAll my fake friends are here!Getting Our Flawlessly Inferred Table Schema\nBigQuery surely gets table schemas wrong some of the time. That said, I have yet\nto see it happen. Let's wrap this script up:\n\nfrom google.cloud import storage\nfrom google.cloud import bigquery\nimport pprint\n\nbucket_uri = 'gs://your-bucket/'\nbucket_name = 'your-bucket'\nbucket_target = 'datasets/data_upload.csv'\nlocal_dataset = 'data/test.csv'\nbucket_target_uri = bucket_uri + bucket_target\nbigquery_dataset = 'uploadtest'\nbigquery_table = 'my_table'\n\n\ndef upload_blob(bucket_name, source_file_name, destination_blob_name):\n    \"\"\"Upload a CSV to Google Cloud Storage.\n\n    1.

This allows us to call upon get_table(), which returns a Table\nclass representing the table we just created. Amongst the methods of that class,\nwe can call .schema(), which gives us precisely what we want: a beautiful\nrepresentation of a Table schema, generated from raw CSV information, where\nthere previously was none.\n\nBehold the fruits of your labor:\n\n[   SchemaField('id', 'INTEGER', 'NULLABLE', None, ()),\n    SchemaField('initiated', 'TIMESTAMP', 'NULLABLE', None, ()),\n    SchemaField('hiredate', 'DATE', 'NULLABLE', None, ()),\n    SchemaField('email', 'STRING', 'NULLABLE', None, ()),\n    SchemaField('firstname', 'STRING', 'NULLABLE', None, ()),\n    SchemaField('lastname', 'STRING', 'NULLABLE', None, ()),\n    SchemaField('title', 'STRING', 'NULLABLE', None, ()),\n    SchemaField('department', 'STRING', 'NULLABLE', None, ()),\n    SchemaField('location', 'STRING', 'NULLABLE', None, ()),\n    SchemaField('country', 'STRING', 'NULLABLE', None, ()),\n    SchemaField('type', 'STRING', 'NULLABLE', None, ())]\n\n\nThere you have it; a correctly inferred schema, from data which wasn't entirely\nclean in the first place (our dates are in MM/DD/YY  format as opposed to \nMM/DD/YYYY, but Google still gets it right. How? Because Google).\n\nIt Doesn't End Here\nI hope it goes without saying that abusing Google BigQuery's API to generate\nschemas for you is only a small, obscure use case of what Google BigQuery is\nintended to do, and what it can do for you. That said, I need to stop this\nfanboying post before anybody realizes I'll promote their products for free\nforever (I think I may have passed that point).\n\nIn case you're interested, the source code for this script has been uploaded as\na Gist here\n[https://gist.github.com/toddbirchard/a743db3b8805dfe9834e73c530dc8a6e].

I provided a more gimmicky approach by leveraging the <a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/infer-datatypes-from-csvs-to-create/\">Python table-schema library</a>. With BigQuery, we find yet another alternative which is neither manual or gimmicky: perfect for those who are lazy, rich, and demand perfection (AKA: your clients, probably).</p><p>First, we'll need to get our data into BigQuery</p><h2 id=\"uploading-data-into-google-cloud-storage-via-the-python-sdk\">Uploading Data into Google Cloud Storage via the Python SDK</h2><p>BigQuery requires us to go through Google Cloud Storage as a buffer before inputting data into tables.

In BigQuery, tables can belong to a 'dataset,' which is a grouping of tables. Compare this concept to MongoDB's <strong>collections, </strong>or PostgreSQL's <strong>schemas</strong>. Note that this process is made much easier by the fact that we stored our project key locally: otherwise, we'd have to specify which Google Cloud project we're looking for, etc.</p><p>With the dataset specified, we begin to build our \"job\" object with <code>LoadJobConfig</code>. This is like loading a gun before unleashing a shotgun blast into the face of our problems. Alternatively, a more relevant comparison could be with the Python <code>requests</code> library and the act of prepping an API request before execution.</p><p>We set <code>job_config.autodetect</code> to be <code>True</code>, obviously. <code>job_config.skip_leading_rows</code> reserves our header row from screwing things up.</p><p><code>load_job</code> puts our request together, and <code>load_job.result()</code> executes said job. The <code>.result()</code> method graciously puts the rest of our script on hold until the specified job is completed. In our case, we want this happen: it simplifies our script so that we don't need to verify this manually before moving on.</p><p>Let's see what running that job with our fake data looks like in the BigQuery UI:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/images/Screen-Shot-2019-02-01-at-7.42.52-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>All my fake friends are here!</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"getting-our-flawlessly-inferred-table-schema\">Getting Our Flawlessly Inferred Table Schema</h2><p>BigQuery surely gets table schemas wrong <em>some </em>of the time.
