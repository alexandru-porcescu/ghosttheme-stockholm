Â Do not put this in a\nscript that's going to be running unsupervised. Â This is for interactive\nsessions where you're prototyping the data cleaning methods that you're going to\nuse, and/or just manually entering stuff. Â Especially if there's any chance\nthere could be something malicious hiding in the data to be uploaded. Â We're\ngoing to be executing formatted strings of SQL unsanitized code. Â Also, this\nwill lead to LOTS of silent failures, which are arguably The Worst Thing - if\nguaranteed correctness is a requirement, leave this for the tinkering table.\nÂ Alternatively, if it's a project where \"getting something in there is better\nthan nothing\", this can provide a lot of bang for your buck. Â Actually, it's\npurely for entertainment purposes and not for human consumption.\n\nLet's say you were helping someone take a bunch of scattered Excel files and\nCSVs and input them all into a MySQL database. Â This is a very iterative, trial\n& error process. Â We certainly don't want to be re-entering a bunch of\nboilerplate. Â Pandas to the rescue! Â We can painlessly load those files into a\nDataFrame, then just export them to the db!\n\nWell, not so fast Â First off, loading stuff into a DB is a task all its own -\nPandas and your RDBMS have different kinds of tolerance for mistakes, and differ\nin often-unpredictable ways. Â For example, one time I was performing a task\nsimilar to the one described here (taking scattered files and loading them into\na DB) - I was speeding along nicely, but then ran into a speedbump: turns out\nPandas generally doesn't infer that a column is a date unless you tell it\nspecifically, and will generally parse dates as strings. Â Now, this was fine\nwhen the dates were present - MySQL is pretty smart about accepting different\nforms of dates & times. Â But one thing it doesn't like is accepting an empty\nstring ''  into a date or time column. Â Not a huge deal, just had to cast the\ncolumn as a date:\n\ndf['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])\n\n\nNow the blank strings are NaT, which MySQL knows how to handle!\n\nThis was simple enough, but there's all kinds of little hiccups that can happen.\nÂ And, unfortunately, writing a DataFrame to a DB table is an all-or-nothing\naffair - if there's one error, that means none of the rows will write. Â Which\ncan get pretty annoying if you were trying to write a decent-sized DataFrame,\nespecially if the first error doesn't show up until one of the later rows.\nÂ Waiting sucks. Â And it's not just about being impatient - long waiting times\ncan disrupt your flow.\n\nRapid prototyping & highly-interactive development are some of Python's greatest\nstrengths, and they are great strengths indeed! Â Paul Graham (one of the guys\nbehind Y Combinator) once made the comparison between REPL-heavy development and\nthe popularizing of oil paints (he was talking about LISP, but it's also quite\ntrue of Python, as Python took a lot of its cues from LISP):\n\n> Before oil paint became popular, painters used a medium, called tempera , that\ncannot be blended or over-painted. The cost of mistakes was high, and this\ntended to make painters conservative. Then came oil paint, and with it a great\nchange in style. Oil \"allows for second thoughts\". This proved a decisive\nadvantage in dealing with difficult subjects like the human figure.The new\nmedium did not just make painters' lives easier. It made possible a new and more\nambitious kind of painting. Janson writes:Without oil, the Flemish Masters'\nconquest of visible reality would have been much more limited. Thus, from a\ntechnical point of view, too, they deserve to be called the \"fathers of modern\npainting\" , for oil has been the painter's basic medium ever since. As a\nmaterial, tempera is no less beautiful than oil. But the flexibility of oil\npaint gives greater scope to the imagination--that was the deciding factor.\nProgramming is now undergoing a similar change...Meanwhile, ideas borrowed from\nLisp increasingly turn up in the mainstream: interactive programming\nenvironments, garbage collection, and run-time typing  to name a few.More\npowerful tools are taking the risk out of exploration. That's good news for\nprogrammers, because it means that we will be able to undertake more ambitious\nprojects. The use of oil paint certainly had this effect. The period immediately\nfollowing its adoption was a golden age for painting. There are signs already\nthat something similar is happening in programming.\n(Emphasis mine)\nFrom here: http://www.cs.oswego.edu/~blue/xhx/books/ai/ns1/section02/main.html\nA little scenario to demonstrate:\n\nLet's pretend we have a MySQL instance running, and have already created a\ndatabase named items:\n\nimport pymysql\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nimport sqlalchemy\nimport pandas as pd\n\ncnx = create_engine('mysql+pymysql://analyst:badsecuritykills@localhost:3306/items')\n\npd.io.sql.execute(\"\"\"CREATE TABLE books( \\\nid                               VARCHAR(40) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL \\\n,author                          VARCHAR(255) \\\n,copies                          INT)\"\"\", cnx)\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"author\": [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"],\n    \"copies\": [2, \"\", 7, ],}, \n    index = [1, 2, 3])\n    #Notice that one of these has the wrong data type!\n    \ndf.to_sql(name='books',con=cnx,if_exists='append',index=False)\n#Yeah, I'm not listing this whole stacktrace.  Fantastic package with some extremely helpful Exceptions, but you've gotta scroll a whole bunch to find em.

Â Instant feedback!","html":"<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The following is FANTASTICALLY not-secure. Â Do not put this in a script that's going to be running unsupervised. Â This is for interactive sessions where you're prototyping the data cleaning methods that you're going to use, and/or just manually entering stuff. Â Especially if there's any chance there could be something malicious hiding in the data to be uploaded. Â We're going to be executing formatted strings of SQL unsanitized code. Â Also, this will lead to LOTS of silent failures, which are arguably The Worst Thing - if guaranteed correctness is a requirement, leave this for the tinkering table. Â Alternatively, if it's a project where \"getting something in there is better than nothing\", this can provide a lot of bang for your buck. Â Actually, it's purely for entertainment purposes and not for human consumption.</p><p>Let's say you were helping someone take a bunch of scattered Excel files and CSVs and input them all into a MySQL database. Â This is a very iterative, trial &amp; error process. Â We certainly don't want to be re-entering a bunch of boilerplate. Â Pandas to the rescue! Â We can painlessly load those files into a DataFrame, then just export them to the db!</p><p>Well, not so fast Â First off, loading stuff into a DB is a task all its own - Pandas and your RDBMS have different kinds of tolerance for mistakes, and differ in often-unpredictable ways. Â For example, one time I was performing a task similar to the one described here (taking scattered files and loading them into a DB) - I was speeding along nicely, but then ran into a speedbump: turns out Pandas generally doesn't infer that a column is a date unless you tell it specifically, and will generally parse dates as strings. Â Now, this was fine when the dates were present - MySQL is pretty smart about accepting different forms of dates &amp; times. Â But one thing it doesn't like is accepting an empty string <code>''</code> into a date or time column. Â Not a huge deal, just had to cast the column as a date:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-python\">df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Now the blank strings are <code>NaT</code>, which MySQL knows how to handle!</p><p>This was simple enough, but there's all kinds of little hiccups that can happen. Â And, unfortunately, writing a DataFrame to a DB table is an all-or-nothing affair - if there's one error, that means none of the rows will write. Â Which can get pretty annoying if you were trying to write a decent-sized DataFrame, especially if the first error doesn't show up until one of the later rows. Â Waiting sucks. Â And it's not just about being impatient - long waiting times can disrupt your flow.</p><p>Rapid prototyping &amp; highly-interactive development are some of Python's greatest strengths, and they are great strengths indeed! Â Paul Graham (one of the guys behind Y Combinator) once made the comparison between REPL-heavy development and the popularizing of oil paints (he was talking about LISP, but it's also quite true of Python, as Python took a lot of its cues from LISP):</p><blockquote>Before oil paint became popular, painters used a medium, called tempera , that cannot be blended or over-painted. The cost of mistakes was high, and this tended to make painters conservative. Then came oil paint, and with it a great change in style. Oil \"allows for second thoughts\". This proved a decisive advantage in dealing with difficult subjects like the human figure.The new medium did not just make painters' lives easier. It made possible a new and more ambitious kind of painting. Janson writes:Without oil, the Flemish Masters' conquest of visible reality would have been much more limited. Thus, from a technical point of view, too, they deserve to be called the \"fathers of modern painting\" , for oil has been the painter's basic medium ever since. As a material, tempera is no less beautiful than oil. But the flexibility of oil paint gives greater scope to the imagination--that was the deciding factor.<br>Programming is now undergoing a similar change...Meanwhile, ideas borrowed from Lisp increasingly turn up in the mainstream: <strong>interactive programming environments, garbage collection, and run-time typing</strong> to name a few.More powerful tools are taking the risk out of exploration. That's good news for programmers, because it means that we will be able to undertake more ambitious projects. The use of oil paint certainly had this effect. The period immediately following its adoption was a golden age for painting. There are signs already that something similar is happening in programming.<br>(Emphasis mine)<br>From here: <a href=\"http://www.cs.oswego.edu/~blue/xhx/books/ai/ns1/section02/main.html\">http://www.cs.oswego.edu/~blue/xhx/books/ai/ns1/section02/main.html</a></blockquote><p>A little scenario to demonstrate:</p><p>Let's pretend we have a MySQL instance running, and have already created a database named <code>items</code>:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-python\">import pymysql\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nimport sqlalchemy\nimport pandas as pd\n\ncnx = create_engine('mysql+pymysql://analyst:badsecuritykills@localhost:3306/items')\n\npd.io.sql.execute(&quot;&quot;&quot;CREATE TABLE books( \\\nid                               VARCHAR(40) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL \\\n,author                          VARCHAR(255) \\\n,copies                          INT)&quot;&quot;&quot;, cnx)\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    &quot;author&quot;: [&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;],\n    &quot;copies&quot;: [2, &quot;&quot;, 7, ],}, \n    index = [1, 2, 3])\n    #Notice that one of these has the wrong data type!\n    \ndf.to_sql(name='books',con=cnx,if_exists='append',index=False)\n#Yeah, I'm not listing this whole stacktrace.
