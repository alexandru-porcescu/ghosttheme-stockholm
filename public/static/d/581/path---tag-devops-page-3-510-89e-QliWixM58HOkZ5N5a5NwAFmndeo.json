This\nleads us to the next most logical thing to ask: how can I use this in any\nmeaningful way?\n\nMySQL installations default to refusing connections outside of the local\nmachine's IP address, as we should expect. That said, relational databases\naren't usually being used by a single person on a single machine forever (but if\nyou do, we should hang out). It goes without saying that our MySQL instance\nshould be focusing on uptime and accessibility, or in other terms, far away from\nour destructive personalities.\n\nI adore maintaining databases in the command line as much as the next\nself-hating masochist, but we'll need to accomplish work at some point. That\nmeans the remote database we just set up needs to be open-minded enough to allow\na connection from, say, the IP address of our personal local machine, which\nhappens to have a sexy GUI installed for this very purpose.\n\nMaking these kinds of configuration changes to any service or web server is\nalways a bit of fun. You think your day might suck until you cone home and a\npiece of software treats you like a cyber criminal, kicking and screaming while\nwe attempt the most basic out-of-the-box functionality.\n\nThe fine print here is that we wouldn't recommend messing with any of these\nsettings unless you know what you're doing. Then again, if you knew what you\nwere doing you probably wouldn't be reading this. The point is, if you mess up,\nit's your fault because we warned you.\n\nThe first thing we'll need to touch is the MySQL config found here on Ubuntu:\n\nvim /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf\n\n\nHere you can set various configurations for MySQL, such as the port number,\ndefault user, etc. The line we're interested in is bind-address.\n\n# The MySQL database server configuration file.\n#\n# You can copy this to one of:\n# - \"/etc/mysql/my.cnf\" to set global options,\n# - \"~/.my.cnf\" to set user-specific options.\n# \n# One can use all long options that the program supports.\n# Run program with --help to get a list of available options and with\n# --print-defaults to see which it would actually understand and use.\n#\n# For explanations see\n# http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/server-system-variables.html\n\n# This will be passed to all mysql clients\n# It has been reported that passwords should be enclosed with ticks/quotes\n# escpecially if they contain \"#\" chars...\n# Remember to edit /etc/mysql/debian.cnf when changing the socket location.\n\n# Here is entries for some specific programs\n# The following values assume you have at least 32M ram\n\n[mysqld_safe]\nsocket          = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock\nnice            = 0\n\n[mysqld]\n#\n# * Basic Settings\n#\nuser            = mysql\npid-file        = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid\nsocket          = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock\nport            = 3306\nbasedir         = /usr\ndatadir         = /var/lib/mysql\ntmpdir          = /tmp\nlc-messages-dir = /usr/share/mysql\nskip-external-locking\n#\n# Instead of skip-networking the default is now to listen only on\n# localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure.\nbind-address           = 127.0.0.1\n\n\nBy default, bind-address is set to your local host. This is basically a\nwhitelist that allows changes only from the domains or IP addresses specified.\nYou can go ahead and add the address of the external domain you'd like to grant\naccess to here.\n\nCommenting out the line completely opens up MySQL to everybody. So there's that.\n\nNow we need to create a user with which to access the DBL:\n\nmysql -u root -p -h localhost -P 3306\n\n\nUse the CREATE USER  command to create a new homie. In the example below,\n'newuser' is the name of the new user, and '%' is from which location the user\nwill be permitted to make changes. This is usually 'localhost', for example. In\nthis case, we added '%' which means everywhere.\n\nmysql> CREATE USER ‘newuser’@‘%' IDENTIFIED BY ‘password123’;\n\n\nGrant all privileges to the new user, and always flush privileges  after making\nsuch modifications.\n\nmysql> GRANT ALL ON *.* to newuser@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password123';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\n\nWith these changes made, restart MySQL.\n\nservice mysql restart\n\n\nAssuming this was done correctly, your DB should now be able to receive\nread/write queries from an external source, provided the correct username and\npassword are used.","html":"<p>In the <a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/set-up-mysql-database/\">previous post</a>, we got familiar with the basics of creating and navigating MySQL databases.

That said, relational databases aren't usually being used by a single person on a single machine forever (but if you do, we should hang out). It goes without saying that our MySQL instance should be focusing on uptime and accessibility, or in other terms, far away from our destructive personalities.</p><p>I adore maintaining databases in the command line as much as the next self-hating masochist, but we'll need to accomplish work at some point. That means the remote database we just set up needs to be open-minded enough to allow a connection from, say, the IP address of our personal local machine, which happens to have a sexy GUI installed for this very purpose.</p><p>Making these kinds of configuration changes to any service or web server is always a bit of fun. You think your day might suck until you cone home and a piece of software treats you like a cyber criminal, kicking and screaming while we attempt the most basic out-of-the-box functionality.</p><p>The fine print here is that we wouldn't recommend messing with any of these settings unless you know what you're doing. Then again, if you knew what you were doing you probably wouldn't be reading this.
