This is why before moving forward, I'd like to be\ntransparent that this blog has become little more than thinly veiled Google\npropaganda, where I will henceforth bombard you with persuasive and subtle\nmessaging to sell your soul to Google. Let's be honest; they've probably\nsimulated it anyway.\n\nIt should be safe to assume that you're fairly familiar with AWS Lambda\nFunctions [https://hackersandslackers.com/creating-endpoints-with-lambda/],\nwhich have served as the backbone of what we refer to as \"serverless.\" These\ncode snippets in the cloud have restructured entire IT departments and are\npartially why almost nobody knows enough basic Linux to configure a web server\nor build anything without a vendor. In my opinion, Google Cloud Functions are\nbetter than that, so strap in.\n\nAWS vs GCP Comparison\nFirst off, let's talk about a big one: price. AWS charges based on Lambda usage,\nwhereas Google Cloud Functions are free. The only exception to this is when you\nbreak 2 million invocations/month, at which point you'll be hemorrhaging as\nghastly 40 cents per additional million. That's ridiculous. I think we've just\ndiscovered Google Cloud's lead generation strategy.\n\nWhat about in terms of workflow? AWS holds an architecture philosophy of\nchaining services together, into what inevitably becomes a web of self-contained\nbillable items on your invoice. A fine illustration of this is a fine post on \ncommon AWS patterns\n[https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-microservice-patterns-for-aws/]  which\nprovides a decent visual of this complexity, while also revealing how much\npeople apparently love this kind of shit, as though SaaS is the new Legos. To\ninteract with a Lambda function in AWS via HTTP requests, you need to set up an\nAPI Gateway in front. I hate setting up API Gateways: it's a feat more\nconvoluted and difficult than actually coding. Pair this with an inevitable user\npermission struggle just to get the right Lambda roles set up, and you quickly\nhave yourself a nightmare- especially  if you're just trying to get a single\nfunction live.  Eventually you’ll get to write some code or upload a horrendous\nzip file like some sort of neanderthal (friendly reminder: I am entirely\nbiased).\n\nGCP has clearly been taking notes on the sidelines on how to improve this\nprocess by removing red tape around service setup or policy configuration. AWS\nand GCP are tackling opposites approaches; AWS allows you to build a Robust API\ncomplete with staging and testing with the intent that some of these APIs can\neven be sold as standalone products to consumers. GCP takes the opposite\napproach: cloud functions are services intended for developers to develop, which\ncovers the vast majority of use cases in my opinion.\n\nCloud Function Deployment\nTo create our first function to serve as an endpoint, we'll utilize the\nfollowing:\n\n * A new Cloud Function  running Python 3.7\n * Google's Source Repositories: AKA a Github/Bitbucket clone with auto-syncing\n   to your real repos, along with direct access to GCP services (think Heroku's\n   source control).\n * The gcloud  CLI to enable us to work locally.\n\nYou should immediately notice the glaring lack of any mentions of API endpoints,\nmethods, stages, or anything related to handling web requests. It should not be\nunderstated that Cloud Functions are preconfigured with an endpoint, and all\nnonsense regarding whether endpoints accept GET or POST or AUTH or OPTIONs is\nmissing entirely. These things are handled in the function itself, and because\nGoogle Cloud functions running Python are preconfigured with Flask, all of that\nstuff is really trivially easy.  That's right, we've got Flask, Python,  and GCP \n all in a single post. Typing these words feels like eating cake while Dwyane\nThe Rock Johnson reads me bedtime stories and caresses me as I fall asleep. It's\ngreat.\n\nCreate your Function\nOur function will intend to serve as a Python HTTP endpoint:\n\nSingle-page setup. Easy. * Trigger  specifies what will have access to this function. By selecting HTTP,\n   we will immediately receive a URL.\n * Source code  gives us a few options to deploy our code with cloud source\n   repository  being by far the easiest solution, especially when working\n   locally.\n * Runtime  allows you to select NodeJS by accident.\n\nBefore we get to code, let's talk Python libraries.\n\nIncluding Dependencies in your Function\nOur function comes prepared with two files: main.py  and our friend \nrequirements.txt. These files do exactly what you'd expect, as per every project\never:\n\nUnfortunately, ease-of-use ensures that GCP certifications will be in low\ndemand.Our function immediately installs all dependencies in requirements.txt  for use\nupon deployment. Once deployed, we can import these libraries as expected. So,\nlet's deploy something.\n\nGoogle Source Repositories\nGoogle's source repositories can serve as a stand-in replacement for Github\n(unlikely), or auto-sync to any repo on the version control behemoth of your\nchoice. The advantage of this extra layer is mostly to trigger deployments upon\ncommits, which in turn feed into GCP's own CI/CD processes (which remain young\nfor now). Create a repo locally using gcloud:\n\n$ gcloud source repos create real-repo\n$ cd myproject/\n$ git init\n--------------------------------------------------------\n(take a moment to write or save some actual code here)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n$ git add --all\n$ git remote add google https://source.developers.google.com/p/hackers/r/real-repo\n$ git commit -m 'cheesey init message'\n$ git push --all google\n\n\nNow make that puppy go live with gcloud functions deploy totally-dope-function,\nwhere totally-dope-function  is name of your function, as it should be.\n\nNow let's get to the coding part.\n\nThe Coding Part (ft. Flask)\nHere's perhaps the most basic endpoint you'll ever create:\n\nimport requests\n\ndef endpoint(request):\n    \"\"\"Does the things.\"\"\"\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n    # Allows POST requests from any origin with the Content-Type\n    # header and caches preflight response for an 3600s\n    headers = {\n        'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',\n        'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'POST',\n        'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type',\n        'Access-Control-Max-Age': '3600'\n    }\n    request_json = request.get_json()\n    if request_json:\n        plaintext = request_json['plain']\n        html = request_json['html']\n        return html\n    else:\n        return 'You didn't pass a JSON body you idiot.'\n\n\nIf you're familiar with Flask (you are, because you're on this blog) you already\nknow what all of this does. Look at that simple copy-paste of headers, as\nopposed to working them into a horrible web interface. Gasp in disbelief as you\nrealize that typing if request.method == 'POST':  would be a 10-minute task in a\nvisual API building tool. We've made it fam.\n\nEase of Logging\nBecause we have a real endpoint to work with, we don't need to waste any time\nsimulating stupid fucking tests where we send fake JSON to our function. We can\nuse postman or anything to immediately interact with our endpoint, and the logs\nare a click away:\n\nEasy. Breezy. Beautiful.There's no point in me droning on at this point because\nyou've surely already ventured into the Google Cloud console in blissful\ndisbelief as a good obedient drone would. If adopting Google Cloud is the last\nshred of hope we have to resist Google's all-knowing algorithms which have\nalready replaced the illusion of free will, I'd gladly take that dystopia over\nsetting up monolithic API Gateways any day.\n\nThe Downsides\nTime for the asterisks to kill that euphoric buzz you might've experienced for a\nbrief moment. My sole purpose as an engineer is to have my dreams crushed\nfull-time; I simply cant resist returning the favor.\n\nFirst notable drawback of Cloud functions is a lack of out-of-the-box custom DNS \n configuration. Firebase has workarounds for this, but Firebase is a beast of\nits own.\n\nWhen it comes to debugging, functions tend to fall short in comparison to their\nLambda rivals. Most Cloud Function debugging involves deploying, testing in dev,\nand sifting through cryptic error logs (they can be quite bad). There's nearly\nno UI mock testing  to speak of. You'd better brush up on PyTest.\n\nMy best advice is to be careful with what services you play around with on GCP.\nLet's not forget this is a platform geared exclusively towards enterprises; the\nfact that we're even playing ball here makes us weirdos in the first place.\nDon't let yourself hemorrhage money like an enterprise.","html":"<p>The more I explore Google Cloud's endless catalog of cloud services, the more I really like Google Cloud.

Compared to every other web framework,\ngetting a \"Hello world\" to flash on screen without being hassled with database\nconfigurations, template preferences, or reverse proxy setups felt a lot like\nrobbing a bank.\n\nAt some point or another, we inevitably pause the party and take a look around.\nAll of our views are smashed into a single file named something meaningless like\n app.py. All logic lives in the root directory. We're in our 30s and the app\nwe've just created looks as terrible as our bathrooms. It's time to get our shit\ntogether.\n\nThe Flask Application Factory\nThe overwhelming preference to start a Flask application is to use a structure\ndubbed the Application Factory\n[http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/patterns/appfactories/]. The gist is to keep\nthe initialization preferences of our application in a single __init__.py  file,\nsometimes borrowing help from peer files such as db.py  or models.py. Either\nway, the gist is to keep global logic separated from the other parts.\n\nA simple app using the application factory method might look something like\nthis:\n\n[app]\n├── myapp/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── db.py\n│   ├── forms.py\n│   ├── models.py\n│   ├── views.py\n│   ├── static/\n│   └── templates/\n├── config.py\n├── requirements.txt\n├── setup.py\n├── Pipfile\n├── Pipfile.lock\n├── README.md\n├── app.json\n└── wsgi.py\n\n\nThe main takeaway here being the presence of the myapp  directory which now\nhouses our app logic, and the presence of our good friend __init__.py.\n\nAn example of what might live in __init.py__  could be something like this:\n\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom flask import Flask, g\nfrom config import BaseConfig\nfrom flask_login import LoginManager\nfrom flask_pymongo import PyMongo\n\n\ndef create_app():\n    app = Flask(__name__, instance_relative_config=True)\n    app.config.from_object('config.BaseConfig')\n    login = LoginManager()\n\n    with app.app_context():\n        from . import views\n        from . import auth\n        login.init_app(app)\n        mongo = PyMongo(app, app.config['MONGO_URI'])\n        app.register_blueprint(views.main)\n        app.register_blueprint(admin.admin)\n\n        return app\n\n\nHere we initialize our app and the dependencies we'd like to initialize within a\nsingle function. Most familiar might be the first two lines of our function: The\nfirst creating our app object, and the second loading a config from a class in a\nconfig file.\n\nAnother common practice is to keep libraries which need to run init_app  in this\nfile as well. This could be something like the LoginManager  seen in the example\nabove, or a global database configuration. Lastly, this is also where we would\nregister any Blueprints  as well.\n\nUsing Blueprints in Flask\nWhile the Application Factory is an excellent first step to building cohesive\napps, we haven't solved the problem of organizing our app into separation of\nconcerns. Blueprints  are a way for us to separate our app into parts which\nshare very little with one another. Prime examples would include apps with an \nadmin  panel with an accompanying client-facing  side, or apps where the \"logged\nin\" state is vastly different from the app's \"logged out\"  state. In these\ncases, it seems silly to mix both logic and static assets into a single lump,\nwhich is where Blueprints come in.\n\nNOTE:  If you're a Django person and this is all starting to sound familiar,\nthat's because we can equate Flask's Blueprints  to Django's concept of apps. \nThere are differences and added flexibility, but the concept remains the same.\n\nRegistering a part of your app as a Blueprint begins with the following two\nlines:\n\nfrom flask import Blueprint\n\nauth = Blueprint('auth', __name__)\n\n\nWhen we registered the admin  Blueprint previously in __init__.py, the line \napp.register_blueprint(admin.admin)  is essentially saying \"look for a Blueprint \n named admin  in a module (either file or folder structure) called admin.\"  It's\nimportant not to overlook the concept that Blueprints can either be single files\nor entirely standalone file structures with their own templates and static\nfiles.  For instance, a Flask app with completely decoupled Blueprints might be\nstructured as follows:\n\n[app]\n├── myapp/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── admin/\n│   │    ├── __init__.py\n│   │    ├── views.py\n│   │    ├── forms.py\n│   │    ├── static/\n│   │\t └── templates/\n│   ├── frontend/\n│   │    ├── __init__.py\n│   │    ├── views.py\n│   │    ├── forms.py\n│   │    ├── static/\n│   │\t └── templates/  \n│   ├── db.py\n│   ├── forms.py\n│   ├── models.py\n│   └── views.py\n├── config.py\n├── requirements.txt\n├── setup.py\n├── Pipfile\n├── Pipfile.lock\n├── README.md\n├── app.json\n└── wsgi.py\n        \n\n\nIn the case above, each Blueprint  stands as though it were its own Python\nmodule. Each blueprint contains its own logic, templates, and static files -\npresumably encapsulated in a way which makes sense.\n\nUsing Flask-Assets with Blueprints\nWe've already forced a lot of information down your throat, but there's one last\nthing worth mentioning in this overview of working with Blueprints, which is\nworking with assets. We've previously looked at the Flask-Static-Compress \nlibrary for static asset management, but Blueprints  lend themselves better to \nFlask-Assets  way of thinking.\n\nFlask-Assets  is a library which creates a bundle (aka compressed) of assets\nupfront. Thus, the start of a Blueprint definition might now look something like\nthis:\n\nfrom flask import Blueprint\nfrom flask_assets import Environment, Bundle, build\nimport sass\n\nauth = Blueprint('admin', __name__)\n\nassets = Environment(admin)\nscss = Bundle('scss/main.scss', 'scss/forms.scss', filters='libsass', output='build/css/style.css')\nassets.register('scss_all', scss)\nscss.build()\n\n\nEnvironment  states the context of our asset bundle, which is admin, the current\nBlueprint. \n\nBundle  takes any number of files to compressed together as arguments. Then we\nmust pass the type of \"filter\" the assets are (typically a precompiler) and of\ncourse an output destination for the Bundle.\n\n.register()  registers the bundle we just created, not unlike the way we\nregistered our Blueprint.\n\n.build()  must be called explicitly in order to build the bundle at runtime.\nConversely, we could intentionally exclude .build()  if we expect our assets are\nnot to change.\n\nAnd Now You Know Everything\n...or not, really. The most we should take from this post is:\n\n * There's a better way to structure our apps.\n * There are many potential decisions we can make about the structure of our\n   app.\n * There's way more stuff we need to Google or look up on StackOverflow.\n\nTruthfully, there are plenty of resources within Flask's documentation\n[http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/views/#]  or around the internet that\ncovers the topic of Flask app organization and its granular topics more than\nthis single post could ever hope to. Nonetheless, here's to hoping you're\nfeeling a sense of direction in these crazy, adult lives of ours.","html":"<p>When we first started developing in Flask, most of us took the 5 lines of code in the quick-start guide and ran with it.

Then we must pass the type of \"filter\" the assets are (typically a precompiler) and of course an output destination for the Bundle.</p><p><code>.register()</code> registers the bundle we just created, not unlike the way we registered our Blueprint.</p><p><code>.build()</code> must be called explicitly in order to build the bundle at runtime. Conversely, we could intentionally exclude <code>.build()</code> if we expect our assets are not to change.</p><h2 id=\"and-now-you-know-everything\">And Now You Know Everything</h2><p>...or not, really.

There's an API you're working with, and\nit's great. It contains all the information you're looking for, but there's just\none problem: the complexity of nested JSON objects is endless, and suddenly the\njob you love needs to be put on hold to painstakingly retrieve the data you\nactually want, and it's 5 levels deep in a nested JSON hell. Nobody feels like\nmuch of a \"scientist\" or an \"engineer\" when half their day becomes dealing with\nkey value errors.\n\nLuckily, we code in Python!  (okay fine, language doesn't make much of a\ndifference here. It felt like a rallying call at the time).\n\nUsing Google Maps API as an Example\nTo visualize the problem, let's take an example somebody might actually want to\nuse.  I think the  Google Maps API is a good candidate to fit the bill here.\n\nWhile Google Maps is actually a collection of APIs, the Google Maps Distance\nMatrix [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/start].\nThe idea is that with a single API call, a user can calculate the distance and\ntime traveled between an origin and an infinite number of destinations. It's a\ngreat full-featured API, but as you might imagine the resulting JSON for\ncalculating commute time between where you stand and every location in the\nconceivable universe  makes an awfully complex JSON structure.\n\nGetting a Taste of JSON Hell\nReal quick, here's an example of the types of parameters this request accepts:\n\nimport requests\nimport API_KEY\n\ndef google_api_matrix():\n    \"\"\"Example Google Distance Matrix function.\"\"\"\n    endpoint = \"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json\"\n    params = {\n       'units': 'imperial',\n       'key': API_KEY,\n       'origins': 'New York City, NY',\n       'destinations': 'Philadelphia,PA',\n       'transit_mode': 'car'\n    }\n    r = requests.get(endpoint, params=params)\n    return r.json\n\n\nOne origin, one destination. The JSON response for a request this\nstraightforward is quite simple:\n\n{\n    \"destination_addresses\": [\n        \"Philadelphia, PA, USA\"\n    ],\n    \"origin_addresses\": [\n        \"New York, NY, USA\"\n    ],\n    \"rows\": [\n        {\n            \"elements\": [\n                {\n                    \"distance\": {\n                        \"text\": \"94.6 mi\",\n                        \"value\": 152193\n                    },\n                    \"duration\": {\n                        \"text\": \"1 hour 44 mins\",\n                        \"value\": 6227\n                    },\n                    \"status\": \"OK\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ],\n    \"status\": \"OK\"\n}\n\n\nFor each destination, we're getting two data points: the commute distance, and \nestimated duration. If we hypothetically wanted to extract those values, typing \nresponse['rows'][0]['elements']['distance']['test']  isn't too  crazy. I mean,\nit's somewhat awful and brings on casual thoughts of suicide, but nothing out of\nthe ordinary\n\nNow let's make things interesting by adding a few more stops on our trip:\n\nimport requests \nimport API_KEY\n\ndef google_api_matrix():\n    \"\"\"Example Google Distance Matrix function.\"\"\"\n    endpoint = \"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json\"\n    params = {\n       'units': 'imperial',\n       'key': API_KEY,\n       'origins': 'New York City, NY',\n       'destinations': 'Washington,DC|Philadelphia,PA|Santa Barbara,CA|Miami,FL|Austin,TX|Napa County,CA',\n       'transit_mode': 'car'\n    }\n    r = requests.get(endpoint, params=params)\n    return r.json\n\n\nOh fuuucckkkk:\n\n{\n  \"destination_addresses\": [\n    \"Washington, DC, USA\",\n    \"Philadelphia, PA, USA\",\n    \"Santa Barbara, CA, USA\",\n    \"Miami, FL, USA\",\n    \"Austin, TX, USA\",\n    \"Napa County, CA, USA\"\n  ],\n  \"origin_addresses\": [\n    \"New York, NY, USA\"\n  ],\n  \"rows\": [\n    {\n      \"elements\": [\n        {\n          \"distance\": {\n            \"text\": \"227 mi\",\n            \"value\": 365468\n          },\n          \"duration\": {\n            \"text\": \"3 hours 54 mins\",\n            \"value\": 14064\n          },\n          \"status\": \"OK\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"distance\": {\n            \"text\": \"94.6 mi\",\n            \"value\": 152193\n          },\n          \"duration\": {\n            \"text\": \"1 hour 44 mins\",\n            \"value\": 6227\n          },\n          \"status\": \"OK\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"distance\": {\n            \"text\": \"2,878 mi\",\n            \"value\": 4632197\n          },\n          \"duration\": {\n            \"text\": \"1 day 18 hours\",\n            \"value\": 151772\n          },\n          \"status\": \"OK\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"distance\": {\n            \"text\": \"1,286 mi\",\n            \"value\": 2069031\n          },\n          \"duration\": {\n            \"text\": \"18 hours 43 mins\",\n            \"value\": 67405\n          },\n          \"status\": \"OK\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"distance\": {\n            \"text\": \"1,742 mi\",\n            \"value\": 2802972\n          },\n          \"duration\": {\n            \"text\": \"1 day 2 hours\",\n            \"value\": 93070\n          },\n          \"status\": \"OK\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"distance\": {\n            \"text\": \"2,871 mi\",\n            \"value\": 4620514\n          },\n          \"duration\": {\n            \"text\": \"1 day 18 hours\",\n            \"value\": 152913\n          },\n          \"status\": \"OK\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"status\": \"OK\"\n}\n\n\nA lot is happening here. There are objects. There are lists. There are lists of\nobjects which are part of an object. The last thing I'd want to deal with is\ntrying to parse this data only to accidentally get a useless key:value pair like\n \"status\": \"OK\".\n\nCode Snippet To The Rescue\nLet's say we only want the human-readable data from this JSON, which is labeled \n\"text\"  for both distance and duration. We've created a function below dubbed \nextract_values()  to help us resolve this very issue. The idea is that \nextract_values()  is flexible and agnostic, therefore can be imported as a\nmodule into any project you might need.\n\n# recursivejson.py\n\ndef extract_values(obj, key):\n    \"\"\"Pull all values of specified key from nested JSON.\"\"\"\n    arr = []\n\n    def extract(obj, arr, key):\n        \"\"\"Recursively search for values of key in JSON tree.\"\"\"\n        if isinstance(obj, dict):\n            for k, v in obj.items():\n                if isinstance(v, (dict, list)):\n                    extract(v, arr, key)\n                elif k == key:\n                    arr.append(v)\n        elif isinstance(obj, list):\n            for item in obj:\n                extract(item, arr, key)\n        return arr\n\n    results = extract(obj, arr, key)\n    return results\n\n\nWe need to pass this function two values:\n\n * A JSON object, such as r.json()  from an API request.\n * The name of the key  we're looking to extract values from.\n\nnames = extract_values('myjson.json', 'name')\nprint(names)\n\n\nRegardless of where the key \"text\"  lives in the JSON, this function returns\nevery value for the instance of \"key.\" Here's our function in action:\n\nimport requests\nimport API_KEY\nfrom recursivejson import extract_values\n\n\ndef google_api_matrix():\n    \"\"\"Example Google Distance Matrix function.\"\"\"\n    endpoint = \"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json\"\n    params = {\n       'units': 'imperial',\n       'key': API_KEY,\n       'origins': \"New York City,NY\",\n       'destinations': \"Washington,DC|Philadelphia,PA|Santa Barbara,CA|Miami,FL|Austin,TX|Napa Valley,CA\",\n       'transit_mode': 'car',\n    }\n\n   r = requests.get(endpoint, params=params)\n   travel_values = extract_values(r.json(), 'text')\n   return travel_values\n\n\nRunning this function will result in the following output:\n\n['227 mi', '3 hours 54 mins', '94.6 mi', '1 hour 44 mins', '2,878 mi', '1 day 18 hours', '1,286 mi', '18 hours 43 mins', '1,742 mi', '1 day 2 hours', '2,871 mi', '1 day 18 hours']\n\n\nOh fiddle me timbers! Because the Google API alternates between distance and \ntrip duration, every other value alternates between distance and time (can we\npause to appreciate this horrible design? There are infinitely better ways to\nstructure this response). Never fear, some simple Python can help us split this\nlist into two lists:\n\nmy_values = extract_values(r.json(), 'text')\n\ndurations = my_values[1::2]\ndistances = my_values[2::1]\n\nprint('DURATIONS = ', durations)\nprint('DISTANCES = ', distances)\n\n\nThis will take our one list and split it in to two  lists, alternating between\neven and odd:\n\nDURATIONS = ['3 hours 54 mins', '1 hour 44 mins', '1 day 18 hours', '18 hours 43 mins', '1 day 2 hours', '1 day 18 hours']\nDISTANCES = ['94.6 mi', '1 hour 44 mins', '2,878 mi', '1 day 18 hours', '1,286 mi', '18 hours 43 mins', '1,742 mi', '1 day 2 hours', '2,871 mi', '1 day 18 hours']\n\n\nGetting Creative With Lists\nA common theme I run in to while extracting lists of values from JSON objects\nlike these is that the lists of values I extract are very much related.  In the\nabove example, for every duration  we have an accompanying distance, which is a\none-to-one basis. Imagine if we wanted to associate these values somehow?\n\nTo use a better example, I recently I used this exact_values()  function to\nextract lists of column names and their data types from a database schema. As\nseparate lists, the data looked something like this:\n\ncolumn_names = ['index', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'join_date']\ncolumn_datatypes = ['integer', 'string', 'string', 'date']\n\n\nClearly these two lists are directly related; the latter is describing the\nformer. How can this be useful? By using Python's zip  method!\n\nschema_dict = dict(zip(column_names, column_datatypes))\nprint(schema_dict)\n\n\nI like to think they call it zip  because it's like zipping up a zipper, where\neach side of the zipper is a list. This output a dictionary where list 1 serves\nas the keys, and list 2 serves as values:\n\n{\n'index': 'integer', \n'first_name': 'string', \n'last_name':'string',\n'join_date': 'date'\n}\n\n\nAnd there you have it folks: a free code snippet to copy and secretly pretend\nyou wrote forever. I've thrown the function up on Github Gists\n[https://gist.github.com/toddbirchard/b6f86f03f6cf4fc9492ad4349ee7ff8b], if such\na thing pleases you.\n\nIn the meantime, zip it up and zip it out.

I mean, it's somewhat awful and brings on casual thoughts of suicide, but nothing out of the ordinary</p><p>Now let's make things interesting by adding a few more stops on our trip:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">import requests \nimport API_KEY\n\ndef google_api_matrix():\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;Example Google Distance Matrix function.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n    endpoint = &quot;https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json&quot;\n    params = {\n       'units': 'imperial',\n       'key': API_KEY,\n       'origins': 'New York City, NY',\n       'destinations': 'Washington,DC|Philadelphia,PA|Santa Barbara,CA|Miami,FL|Austin,TX|Napa County,CA',\n       'transit_mode': 'car'\n    }\n    r = requests.get(endpoint, params=params)\n    return r.json\n</code></pre>\n<p>Oh fuuucckkkk:</p><pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  &quot;destination_addresses&quot;: [\n    &quot;Washington, DC, USA&quot;,\n    &quot;Philadelphia, PA, USA&quot;,\n    &quot;Santa Barbara, CA, USA&quot;,\n    &quot;Miami, FL, USA&quot;,\n    &quot;Austin, TX, USA&quot;,\n    &quot;Napa County, CA, USA&quot;\n  ],\n  &quot;origin_addresses&quot;: [\n    &quot;New York, NY, USA&quot;\n  ],\n  &quot;rows&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;elements&quot;: [\n        {\n          &quot;distance&quot;: {\n            &quot;text&quot;: &quot;227 mi&quot;,\n            &quot;value&quot;: 365468\n          },\n          &quot;duration&quot;: {\n            &quot;text&quot;: &quot;3 hours 54 mins&quot;,\n            &quot;value&quot;: 14064\n          },\n          &quot;status&quot;: &quot;OK&quot;\n        },\n        {\n          &quot;distance&quot;: {\n            &quot;text&quot;: &quot;94.6 mi&quot;,\n            &quot;value&quot;: 152193\n          },\n          &quot;duration&quot;: {\n            &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1 hour 44 mins&quot;,\n            &quot;value&quot;: 6227\n          },\n          &quot;status&quot;: &quot;OK&quot;\n        },\n        {\n          &quot;distance&quot;: {\n            &quot;text&quot;: &quot;2,878 mi&quot;,\n            &quot;value&quot;: 4632197\n          },\n          &quot;duration&quot;: {\n            &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1 day 18 hours&quot;,\n            &quot;value&quot;: 151772\n          },\n          &quot;status&quot;: &quot;OK&quot;\n        },\n        {\n          &quot;distance&quot;: {\n            &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1,286 mi&quot;,\n            &quot;value&quot;: 2069031\n          },\n          &quot;duration&quot;: {\n            &quot;text&quot;: &quot;18 hours 43 mins&quot;,\n            &quot;value&quot;: 67405\n          },\n          &quot;status&quot;: &quot;OK&quot;\n        },\n        {\n          &quot;distance&quot;: {\n            &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1,742 mi&quot;,\n            &quot;value&quot;: 2802972\n          },\n          &quot;duration&quot;: {\n            &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1 day 2 hours&quot;,\n            &quot;value&quot;: 93070\n          },\n          &quot;status&quot;: &quot;OK&quot;\n        },\n        {\n          &quot;distance&quot;: {\n            &quot;text&quot;: &quot;2,871 mi&quot;,\n            &quot;value&quot;: 4620514\n          },\n          &quot;duration&quot;: {\n            &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1 day 18 hours&quot;,\n            &quot;value&quot;: 152913\n          },\n          &quot;status&quot;: &quot;OK&quot;\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  &quot;status&quot;: &quot;OK&quot;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>A lot is happening here. There are objects. There are lists. There are lists of objects which are part of an object. The last thing I'd want to deal with is trying to parse this data only to accidentally get a useless key:value pair like <strong>\"status\": \"OK\".</strong></p><h2 id=\"code-snippet-to-the-rescue\">Code Snippet To The Rescue</h2><p>Let's say we only want the human-readable data from this JSON, which is labeled <em>\"text\"</em> for both distance and duration. We've created a function below dubbed <code>extract_values()</code> to help us resolve this very issue. The idea is that <code>extract_values()</code> is flexible and agnostic, therefore can be imported as a module into any project you might need.</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\"># recursivejson.py\n\ndef extract_values(obj, key):\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;Pull all values of specified key from nested JSON.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n    arr = []\n\n    def extract(obj, arr, key):\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;Recursively search for values of key in JSON tree.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n        if isinstance(obj, dict):\n            for k, v in obj.items():\n                if isinstance(v, (dict, list)):\n                    extract(v, arr, key)\n                elif k == key:\n                    arr.append(v)\n        elif isinstance(obj, list):\n            for item in obj:\n                extract(item, arr, key)\n        return arr\n\n    results = extract(obj, arr, key)\n    return results\n</code></pre>\n<p>We need to pass this function two values:</p><ul><li>A JSON object, such as <code>r.json()</code> from an API request.</li><li>The name of the <strong>key</strong> we're looking to extract values from.</li></ul><pre><code class=\"language-python\">names = extract_values('myjson.json', 'name')\nprint(names)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Regardless of where the key <strong>\"text\"</strong> lives in the JSON, this function returns every value for the instance of <strong>\"key.\" </strong>Here's our function in action:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">import requests\nimport API_KEY\nfrom recursivejson import extract_values\n\n\ndef google_api_matrix():\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;Example Google Distance Matrix function.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n    endpoint = &quot;https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json&quot;\n    params = {\n       'units': 'imperial',\n       'key': API_KEY,\n       'origins': &quot;New York City,NY&quot;,\n       'destinations': &quot;Washington,DC|Philadelphia,PA|Santa Barbara,CA|Miami,FL|Austin,TX|Napa Valley,CA&quot;,\n       'transit_mode': 'car',\n    }\n\n   r = requests.get(endpoint, params=params)\n   travel_values = extract_values(r.json(), 'text')\n   return travel_values\n</code></pre>\n<p>Running this function will result in the following output:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">['227 mi', '3 hours 54 mins', '94.6 mi', '1 hour 44 mins', '2,878 mi', '1 day 18 hours', '1,286 mi', '18 hours 43 mins', '1,742 mi', '1 day 2 hours', '2,871 mi', '1 day 18 hours']\n</code></pre>\n<p>Oh <em>fiddle me timbers</em>! Because the Google API alternates between <strong>distance </strong>and <strong>trip duration</strong>, every other value alternates between distance and time (can we pause to appreciate this horrible design? There are infinitely better ways to structure this response). Never fear, some simple Python can help us split this list into two lists:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">my_values = extract_values(r.json(), 'text')\n\ndurations = my_values[1::2]\ndistances = my_values[2::1]\n\nprint('DURATIONS = ', durations)\nprint('DISTANCES = ', distances)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will take our one list and split it in to <em>two</em> lists, alternating between even and odd:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">DURATIONS = ['3 hours 54 mins', '1 hour 44 mins', '1 day 18 hours', '18 hours 43 mins', '1 day 2 hours', '1 day 18 hours']\nDISTANCES = ['94.6 mi', '1 hour 44 mins', '2,878 mi', '1 day 18 hours', '1,286 mi', '18 hours 43 mins', '1,742 mi', '1 day 2 hours', '2,871 mi', '1 day 18 hours']\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"getting-creative-with-lists\">Getting Creative With Lists</h2><p>A common theme I run in to while extracting lists of values from JSON objects like these is that the lists of values I extract are very much related.  In the above example, for every <em>duration</em> we have an accompanying <em>distance, </em>which is a one-to-one basis. Imagine if we wanted to associate these values somehow?</p><p>To use a better example, I recently I used this <code>exact_values()</code> function to extract lists of column names and their data types from a database schema. As separate lists, the data looked something like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">column_names = ['index', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'join_date']\ncolumn_datatypes = ['integer', 'string', 'string', 'date']\n</code></pre>\n<p>Clearly these two lists are directly related; the latter is describing the former. How can this be useful? By using Python's <code>zip</code> method!</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">schema_dict = dict(zip(column_names, column_datatypes))\nprint(schema_dict)\n</code></pre>\n<p>I like to think they call it <em>zip</em> because it's like zipping up a zipper, where each side of the zipper is a list. This output a dictionary where list 1 serves as the keys, and list 2 serves as values:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">{\n'index': 'integer', \n'first_name': 'string', \n'last_name':'string',\n'join_date': 'date'\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And there you have it folks: a free code snippet to copy and secretly pretend you wrote forever. I've thrown the function up on <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/toddbirchard/b6f86f03f6cf4fc9492ad4349ee7ff8b\">Github Gists</a>, if such a thing pleases you.</p><p>In the meantime, zip it up and zip it out. Zippity-do-da, buh bye.</p>","url":"https://hackersandslackers.com/extract-data-from-complex-json-python/","uuid":"9a494df4-9e13-45ed-8648-efdda21c55a4","page":false,"codeinjection_foot":"","codeinjection_head":"","comment_id":"5bbd7ce1b936605163ece407"}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c12d7bfe875ad7bb8673717","title":"Lynx Roundup, October 9th","slug":"lynx-roundup-october-9th","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://hackersandslackers.com/content/images/lynx/115@2x.jpg","excerpt":"Recommender system in Python!
