I thought I was, but it isn't until we\nneed to start a new project from scratch that we realize that we totally forgot\nthe configuration process we took last time. That's why I'm here.\n\nLet's have a quick refresher on the parts that make up Handlebars\n\n * Layouts  are the most ambiguous high-level layer; these are commonly used to\n   set underlying page metadata as well as general layout (for lack of a better\n   term).\n * Pages  are templates which equate to one type  of page. For example, the\n   'post' page on this site is unique from, say, the homepage. Because all posts\n   share elements with one another, hundreds of posts share this same template.\n * Partials  are snippets which can be shared between pages, such as navigation.\n * A Context  is content which is passed to templates and result in being the\n   page's content\n * Helpers  are the closest we get to logic in Handlebars: these allow us to\n   display or omit content based on conditionals such as if  statements. For\n   example: showing an author's avatar only if they have uploaded an image.\n\nProject Setup\nWe're going to use the Express /views  folder to contain all of our handlebars\ngoodness. Our project should look something like this:\n\nmyapp\n├── bin\n├── build\n├── routes\n├── src\n├── views\n│   ├── layouts/\n│   ├── partials/\n│   └── error.hbs\n│   └── index.hbs\n│   └── login.hbs\n│   └── etc\n└── README.md\n└── app.js\n└── package.json\n\n\nIt's important to distinguish that we've separated our views folder into three\nclassifications for layouts, partials, and pages, where pages occupy the root \n/views  directory. It's important to keep this distinction as our structure\naffects how we serve up these templates.\n\nConfigure that Ish\nInstall handlebars:\n\nnpm install handlebars --save\n\n\nCrack open your app.js  file or whatever it is you call that thing. Require\nhandlebars:\n\nvar hbs = require( 'express-handlebars');\n\n\nNext we'll configure Express to use Handlebars as the view engine, and tell\nExpress where to find these files:\n\n// view engine setup\napp.set('view engine', 'hbs');\n\napp.engine( 'hbs', hbs( {\n  extname: 'hbs',\n  defaultView: 'default',\n  layoutsDir: __dirname + '/views/pages/',\n  partialsDir: __dirname + '/views/partials/'\n}));\n\n\nExpress assumes by default that we're storing our views in the '/views' folder,\nwhich we are. We take this a step further by specifying which subfolders our \npartials  and layouts  are in above. We can save pages  directly in /views.\n\nNotice that we're also setting a default layout. We can override this in our\nroutes if needed, but setting a default layout is useful for loading pages in an\nhtml wrapper container page metadata.\n\nKicks on Route 66\nLet's create our first route in routes/index.js. We're going to load a view\ncalled home  into a layout called default:\n\nvar express = require('express');\nvar router = express.Router();\n\nrouter.get('/', function(req, res, next) {\n  res.render('home', {layout: 'default', template: 'home-template'});\n});\n\n\nThis will render views/home.hbs  into views/layouts/default.hbs, provided are\nviews are set up correctly. We also pass a custom value template  which is\nuser-defined; more on that below.\n\nBasic Usage\nLet's finally take a look at our actual Handlebars views. Here's default.hbs:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n  <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n  <title>Best Website</title>\n  <meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"True\" />\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover\" />\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/css/main.min.css\">\n</head>\n<body class=\"{{template}}\">\n  <div class=\"container\">\n\t  {{{body}}}\n  </div>\n  {{> footer}}\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\nWe have three values here: {{template}}  and {{{body}}}, and {{> footer}}.\n\n{{template}}  is a value with double brackets, thus is expecting linear data. We\npassed template  in our route: this sets the body class to equal home-template \non the chance that we'll want to apply page-specific styles or logic in the\nfuture.\n\n{{{body}}}  is rocking the triple brackets, and is reserved specifically to\nserve this purpose: loading templates into other templates.\n\nLastly we have {{> footer}}. This will load a partial named footer  from \nviews/partials/footer.hbs, provided that we create it. The difference between\nhow {{{body}}}  and {{> footer}}  are being loaded have to do with a general\nworkflow philosophy; pages are the main event and thus are loaded into layouts\nby their command. Partials can be called by pages at will whenever we please.\n\nThere's obviously a lot more to Handlebars- the fun doesn't truly begin until we\npull dynamic values from databases or wherever. We'll get there.","html":"<p>Writing HTML sucks, thus we should do everything to minimize the time we spend writing it as much as possible.  Thus, we have <a href=\"https://handlebarsjs.com/\">Handlebars</a>: a lightweight templating system for Node.
