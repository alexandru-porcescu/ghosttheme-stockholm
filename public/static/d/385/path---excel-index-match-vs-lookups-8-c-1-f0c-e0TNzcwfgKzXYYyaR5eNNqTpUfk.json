The\nshort answer to this question is \"Index Match was introduced fairly recently,\nand does everything that V/H lookup can do, but faster, more flexibly, and\nrequiring no formatting on your part before using the function.\"\n\nTo get a little bit more specific, V lookup and H lookup give you the same\nresult as Index Match (that is, they give you the associated value of an item\nthat you're looking for in an array, this practice is called a lookup  in the\nbiz) but...\n\n 1. The two lookup formulae require data to be formatted a certain way in order\n    to work.\n 2. V lookup can only look up a value within a column (vertically) and H-lookup\n    within a row (Horizontally).\n 3. The lookup formulae consume a lot more computing power (which actually\n    becomes a big issue when you start dealing with potentially millions of\n    values).\n\nWith that being said, many people (and you'll get there too) tend to \"go with\nwhat they know works\" and because index-match was introduced more recently,\nthose that utilize the lookup functions never found the need to to learn a new\nfunction. However, there is literally NO benefit to using the lookups vs. using\nIndex(Match))  and you can sometimes make a great impression on a mentor if they\nuse lookups, and you can teach them index-match, or even better, if a job\nrequires you to know V-lookups, you can now impress them by explaining the\nbenefits of index-match.\n\nNext time, we make like a startup and PIVOT","html":"<p>You may have picked up in my last post that some fellow wizards (of which I now consider you if you've mastered Index-Match, and you've activated developer mode) who may have started learning Excel prior to 2007 may drop the phrase \"lookup;\" generally in the context of \"V-Lookup\" (or perhaps \"H-Lookup\" if they're working with data that was formatted by savages).</p><p>The question is, if people \"in the know\" are always talking about and using these two formulas, then what do they do, and why haven't we learned it?
