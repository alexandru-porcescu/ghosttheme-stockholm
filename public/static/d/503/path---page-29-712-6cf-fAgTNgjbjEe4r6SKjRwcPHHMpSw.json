I\nhighly recommend you go back and read the first post on \"dirty\" data, but just\nin case you're one of those rebels who thinks that they're too cool to read part\n1, here's a quick refresher to put you back in the analytical mindset (which is\nthe perfect combination tactical laziness, ADHD, and a complete disregard for\ndownside risk).\n\nEssentially, the reason why most data analysts exist within a company (remember,\nNOT a tech company, hence the usage of Excel) is because for whatever reason,\nmost companies do not give analysts access to the data on demand, and instead it\nis tightly controlled by a mysterious cabal of DBAs or developers which I have\nchristened the dataratti.\n\nWhile this setup is workable in theory, the dataratti often do not have a strong\nunderstanding of how the data is used in practice, and there are generally not\nopen lines of communication between the dataratti and the analysts. Thus it\nfalls upon the analyst to do three crucial jobs:\n\n 1. Obtain raw  data from the dataratti (remember, raw means that the data is\n    just a bunch of numbers, words, and headings...meaningless on their own).\n 2. manipulate  the data so that it's in a readable format and does not have\n    unnecessary data.\n 3. Present this data in narrative form to the business people.\n\nNow, you may be asking why they can't just hire someone who knows both sides of\nthis equation, the answer is sadly simple: manipulating data in a tool like\nExcel is antithetical to the general idea of how databases are created (we'll\ntalk about that some more next time) and thus someone who has both skill-sets,\nas well as the ability to present to stakeholders (remember, Those Who Sit Above\nin Shadow?) is extremely rare, and trying to become  that person may not be the\nbest idea because it may actually be cheaper to hire two employees than hire\nsomeone with chops in both skills (and you can't just know  how to\nmanipulate/present and code, you have to know both very well).\n\nWith all that being said, last time we discussed how one might grab data from\nthe dataratti from a tool like Tableau (which is essentially a data\nvisualization toolkit that's really good at creating dashboards, but can only\nhandle limited variables...a.k.a. columns, and exports the actual data in a\nparticularly messy way). Now we'll talk about one of the other possibilities for\nthe enterprising analyst to grab raw data: Business Intelligence (BI) tools.\n\nDespite how cool it sounds and despite it immediately conjuring thoughts of\nengaging in corporate espionage as part of the Business Intelligence Agency, BI\nis at it's core really just an interface where someone who didn't design a\ndatabase can still query (that literally means \"ask\") the database for the data\nthat they want.\n\nThe way this works is pretty straightforward: there will be an interface with a\nseries of folders (just like you'd see on a desktop) and within each, there will\nbe a list of variables that you can drag-and-drop into your query. After putting\nin all of the variables that you want in your report, you just hit \"go\" and\nit'll show you all of the data associated with the variables...essentially\nletting you grab data from the database without touching it, and without knowing\nSQL. To sweeten the already sweet deal, you can even generally manipulate the\ndata after the query is done but before downloading (using a very similar format\nto Excel, although, why fix what ain't broken?), and you can set it up to re-run\nwhatever query you decided upon on a regular schedule.\n\nWell then, doesn't that just sound ideal, why didn't I lead with this clearly\nsuperior strategy? Obviously, there's a catch: not only are BI toolkits VERY\nexpensive, the implementation of a BI tool requires an entire OTHER level of\nemployee between the coders and the analysts. Remember way back when, in a\nprevious post, I stated that databases only build on top of themselves and grow\nincreasingly unwieldy the longer your company is in existence? Also, remember\nwhen I stated that the developers rarely know why their users need the data\nwithin the database? Well, that leads to the developers coding their databases\nin a way that only they  truly understand (if we were talking about anything\nother than a database, I'd even say that their code is...inelegant). Now imagine\nhaving having to take this mess of code on top of code that's starting to look\nlike Tetsuo at the end of Akira, and translating all of it to plain English that\nsomeone with no knowledge of database structures would be able to understand,\nand you're starting to get an idea of the struggle that a BI developer has ahead\nof them.

I highly recommend you go back and read the first post on \"dirty\" data, but just in case you're one of those rebels who thinks that they're too cool to read part 1, here's a quick refresher to put you back in the analytical mindset (which is the perfect combination tactical laziness, ADHD, and a complete disregard for downside risk).</p><p>Essentially, the reason why most data analysts exist within a company (remember, NOT a tech company, hence the usage of Excel) is because for whatever reason, most companies do not give analysts access to the data on demand, and instead it is tightly controlled by a mysterious cabal of DBAs or developers which I have christened the <em>dataratti</em>.</p><p>While this setup is workable in theory, the dataratti often do not have a strong understanding of how the data is used in practice, and there are generally not open lines of communication between the dataratti and the analysts. Thus it falls upon the analyst to do three crucial jobs:</p><ol><li>Obtain <em>raw</em> data from the dataratti (remember, raw means that the data is just a bunch of numbers, words, and headings...meaningless on their own).</li><li><strong>manipulate</strong> the data so that it's in a readable format and does not have unnecessary data.</li><li>Present this data in narrative form to the <em>business people</em>.</li></ol><p>Now, you may be asking why they can't just hire someone who knows both sides of this equation, the answer is sadly simple: manipulating data in a tool like Excel is antithetical to the general idea of how databases are created (we'll talk about that some more next time) and thus someone who has both skill-sets, as well as the ability to present to stakeholders (remember, Those Who Sit Above in Shadow?) is extremely rare, and trying to <em>become</em> that person may not be the best idea because it may actually be cheaper to hire two employees than hire someone with chops in both skills (and you can't just <em>know</em> how to manipulate/present and code, you have to know both very well).</p><p>With all that being said, last time we discussed how one might grab data from the dataratti from a tool like Tableau (which is essentially a data visualization toolkit that's really good at creating dashboards, but can only handle limited variables...a.k.a. columns, and exports the actual data in a particularly messy way). Now we'll talk about one of the other possibilities for the enterprising analyst to grab raw data: Business Intelligence (BI) tools.</p><p>Despite how cool it sounds and despite it immediately conjuring thoughts of engaging in corporate espionage as part of the Business Intelligence Agency, BI is at it's core really just an interface where someone who didn't design a database can still query (that literally means \"ask\") the database for the data that they want.</p><p>The way this works is pretty straightforward: there will be an interface with a series of folders (just like you'd see on a desktop) and within each, there will be a list of variables that you can drag-and-drop into your query. After putting in all of the variables that you want in your report, you just hit \"go\" and it'll show you all of the data associated with the variables...essentially letting you grab data from the database without touching it, and without knowing SQL. To sweeten the already sweet deal, you can even generally manipulate the data after the query is done but before downloading (using a very similar format to Excel, although, why fix what ain't broken?), and you can set it up to re-run whatever query you decided upon on a regular schedule.</p><p>Well then, doesn't that just sound ideal, why didn't I lead with this clearly superior strategy? Obviously, there's a catch: not only are BI toolkits VERY expensive, the implementation of a BI tool requires an entire OTHER level of employee between the coders and the analysts. Remember way back when, in a previous post, I stated that databases only build on top of themselves and grow increasingly unwieldy the longer your company is in existence? Also, remember when I stated that the developers rarely know why their users need the data within the database? Well, that leads to the developers coding their databases in a way that only <em>they</em> truly understand (if we were talking about anything other than a database, I'd even say that their code is...inelegant). Now imagine having having to take this mess of code on top of code that's starting to look like Tetsuo at the end of Akira, and translating all of it to plain English that someone with no knowledge of database structures would be able to understand, and you're starting to get an idea of the struggle that a BI developer has ahead of them. To make matters worse, each BI tool requires this to be done in a specific way, so the skills are only moderately transferable. Of note, in a company that relies on their data quite a bit, and when their database is considerably large, this quickly becomes a full-time job, if not the job of a small team.</p><p>Now, despite the considerable front-end investment in a good BI team, the flexibility of being able to grab data on-demand ends up being significantly better in the long-term, especially when an analyst knows how to use tableau themselves, and can make super slick graphic representations of the data...and everyone knows that the way to a business person's heart is with sick graphics.</p><p>In summary, today we explored the following:</p><ul><li>A refresher of the counter-intuitive model of data siloing within companies.</li><li>An explanation of the role of an analyst within this company hierarchy.</li><li>How BI tools work and what some of the benefits and challenges of implementation may be.</li></ul><p>Now that you know why the data you get comes out dirty, next time, we'll explore some examples of how your data may arrive, and how to sculpt your data so that you can make it work for you.</p><p>Paz,</p><p>-Snacks</p>","url":"https://hackersandslackers.com/dirty-data-in-excel-part-2/","uuid":"ebf58744-d2fb-4210-8e99-06fa163ba193","page":false,"codeinjection_foot":"","codeinjection_head":"","comment_id":"5b16ee675bd3653f82f3a947"}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c12d7bfe875ad7bb8673667","title":"Lynx Roundup, June 5th","slug":"lynx-roundup-june-5th","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://hackersandslackers.com/content/images/lynx/lynx39@2x.jpg","excerpt":"Daily roundup of Data Science news around the industry, 6/5/2018.","custom_excerpt":"Daily roundup of Data Science news around the industry, 6/5/2018.","created_at_pretty":"04 June, 2018","published_at_pretty":"05 June, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"25 July, 2018","created_at":"2018-06-03T22:04:38.000-04:00","published_at":"2018-06-05T07:00:00.000-04:00","updated_at":"2018-07-24T22:06:03.000-04:00","meta_title":"Lynx Roundup, June 5th | Hackers and Slackers","meta_description":"Daily roundup of Data Science news around the industry, 6/5/2018.","og_description":"Daily roundup of Data Science news around the industry, 6/5/2018.","og_image":"https://hackersandslackers.com/content/images/lynx/lynx39@2x.jpg","og_title":"Lynx Roundup, June 5th","twitter_description":"Daily roundup of Data Science news around the industry, 6/5/2018.","twitter_image":"https://hackersandslackers.com/content/images/lynx/lynx39@2x.jpg","twitter_title":"Lynx Roundup, June 5th","authors":[{"name":"Matthew Alhonte","slug":"matt","bio":"Super villain in somebody's action hero movie.

Note that this is a study with an N\n= 1 so it bares no statistical significance, but I have a funny feeling...call\nit spidey sense).\n\nFull disclosure, this post comes mostly out of my inability to sleep in my hotel\nroom in Chicago following a grueling day of doing the very things I discuss in\nthis blog, and preceding a day where I'll have to literally explain my last post\nto the suits, but perhaps this is the best mindset to begin discussing the\nmyriad ways in which you may encounter dirty data in the wild, and how a savvy\nanalyst may pivot and match their way around it. However, if my prose isn't as\non point as you have grown accustomed...blame it on the 4AM haze.\n\nAlas, let's begin by discussing the organizational structure of the majority of\ncorporate entities that leverage data to some degree (note, this isn't all\ncorporations...and what does that say about the state of business?) and how, at\neach step of abstraction in this process that you are from the data, the data\ngets dirtier and dirtier.\n\nEssentially, there's always going to be a group of about 5-10\nfewer-than-necessary legitimately skilled data scientists and/or computer\nprogrammers/DBAs who are really solid at building and maintaining a database as\nwell as coding in some sort of compiling language (nowadays, that's probably\npython, but not exclusively, nor does this matter). However, depending on your\nindustry (unless of course your industry IS data), it's nearly impossible to\nrecruit people who have these skills to the level necessary AND have some\nfamiliarity with why this data is needed, and/or the ability to explain how the\ninternal products that they build can be used by an end user. As such, this team\nhas their own project manager(s) who's only job is to keep these guys from\ndeveloping a sentient AI that's sole goal is the annihilation of unfolded\nlaundry...when your industry is healthcare. This team should also have at least\none analyst who will take the raw code base and do the first step of translation \n to a more user friendly form. This generally takes shape as either dashboards\nin a system like Tableau, or  if your company has a group of particularly strong\ndata/business analysts (or particularly weak programmers) an interface written\nin plain(enough) English on a Business Intelligence platform such as Microsoft\nBI/SAP Business Objects or whatever other system your company utilizes. As a fun\nlittle note, this team ALMOST ALWAYS  is referred to by some sort of acronym\nsuch as QDAR! (Quality data and reporting!) or KMnR! (Knowledge management and\nreporting!) or Those Fucking Guys (who have something to do with reporting)\n(TFG(whstdwr)). On a less fun little note...neither you, nor seemingly ANYONE\nELSE will have contact with this team. In light of this information, how do the\nreports that they build get chosen and who decides how these databases are\nbuilt? The world may never know.\n\nSo let's assume the first type of reporting: the Dataratti  (which is how I will\nrefer to the acronym defined team described above moving forward) produces\ndashboards utilizing a tool such as Tableau or Crystal Reports. You may be\nthinking to yourself: \"hey, isn't my job taking the data and putting it in a\nform where people who are scared by more than two nested groups of parenthesis,\nand thus this renders my job unnecessary?\" The answer to the question is\ntwofold: Yes, and of course not! As mentioned previously, the decision to create\nthese dashboards, the data contained therein, and how you want them to look is\ndecided upon by a mythical creature who has full access and understanding of the\ndata warehouse, AND has full access to and understanding of the stakeholders\n(AKA, Those Who Sit Above in Shadow; that's a reference from a famous run of\nThor comics that refers to to a mysterious cabal of gods who perpetuate the\ncycle of Ragnarok in order to subsist upon the energies created by this\nstrife...which as I write this, is an almost disgustingly on-the-nose metaphor\nfor upper management). Now, if you believe that you may be this mythical\ncreature (as I do), I DARE  you to apply for a job with this job description,\nand once you clinch it with the advice from this blog,  rapidly realize that\nyour job will involve either one of these job duties or the other.\n\nWith that digression, even if somehow a useful dashboard for YOU is created, the\nlimitations inherent in these dashboarding tools make one CRUCIAL issue\nomnipresent: one can only effectively illustrate up to 16 different variables at\na time before the system breaks down (for example, Tableau's documentation\nspecifically warns against this). So even if you have the nicest, most\nillustrative dashboards on the planet from the Dataratti, there is a nearly 100%\nchance that the information that you actually need will be scattered across 2-3\ndifferent dashboards...rendering the nice looking dashboards essentially useless\nfor your purposes, and as previously stated, you have no contact with the\nDataratti, nor do you have access to the underlying data from which these\ndashboards are created. So pop quiz hot shot, what DO you do?\n\nWell, mercifully, all of these dashboard tools allow an end user to download a\n\"data dump\" (our parlance for \"a buncha numbers with headings\"). Using Tableau\nas an example, one can download either a \"crosstab\" or a text file of the data\nrepresented by the dashboard (in both \"summary\" and \"full data\" format). Now,\njust to get the truly gifted in Tableau off my back, yes, the functionality does\nexist to build in the ability to download the data in the exact format necessary\nfor your  needs through a specific combination of custom web server views and\nJavascript, but...\n\n 1. If the users of the dash are exclusively using this function, why do the\n    dashboard at all? And...\n 2. This forces the developers in the Dataratti to have decent web design skills\n    on top of really high level Tableau skills, and it requires someone to\n    anticipate exactly how the data will be used by the end user by the\n    Dataratti (which is incredibly hard as it's impossible to speak to this\n    department directly, and as previously stated, the lack of this  knowledge\n    on their end is the entire reason why my department exists).\n\nA few things to note before downloading data from Tableau:\n\n * You must highlight at least one element of the dashboard before downloading a\n   crosstab.\n * Depending on what kind of dashboard you're working with, you may need to\n   highlight the entirety of one column in order to capture the entirety of your\n   data (click the first element in any column  and then scroll down to the\n   bottom of the report...which may be enormously long, hit shift  and click the\n   last element in the report) before downloading either the data or the\n   crosstab.\n * If you are downloading a crosstab, be wary, Tableau web server caps how many\n   rows you can download in this method at a time, this can be avoided by\n   downloading the text version of the data (by clicking data as opposed to\n   crosstab). HOWEVER...\n * If you are going the data route, it defaults to summary view. Look over all\n   the headings, and ensure that this covers everything you need, otherwise\n   click \"full data\". Interestingly, this still isn't actually the entirety of\n   your data, and continue to check to make sure all of your headings are\n   covered, otherwise, click the display all columns  box, and then download all\n   the rows as a text file.\n\nNow, repeat these steps until all of the data that you need in your  report is\ncontained across these text files (.csv, AKA the Comma Separated Value file\ntype). With all that lunacy completed, you now have several sheets with some\ncommon columns, but all with different information; only some of which you need,\nso what do you think you do?\n\nSimple, you use the tools given to you in the previous posts: you lookup  on the\ncommon factors across the sheets and return the data that you want until you\nhave all the data you need, in the correct order, on one sheet, and then\ndepending on the ask, you may want to pivot that data out in order to summarize \nthe whole mess of data. THIS IS YOUR FINAL PRODUCT  well done. Another protip:\nif you want to reposition data that you've obtained via a lookup, highlight the\nwhole column, hit control+C  to copy the data and then hit control+V  pause a\nsecond (press NOTHING else) and then press control FOLLOWED by V. This takes the\nvalues generated by a formula and replaces them with the values obtained.\nFunctionally, this looks  exactly the same, but now you can move the data around\nwithout affecting or being affected by other data.\n\nAs explaining only one possible dirty data scenario took over 1500 words, next\ntime, we'll discuss the other most common form of taking the dirty data from the\nDataratti and making it useful to you: using business intelligence portals as\nopposed to dashboards in order to grab the data that you need. Also, if I don't\nget roasted on a spit for being half asleep for tomorrow's (today's?) meeting,\nI'll try and write up a companion post with an example of how this works out in\npractice.\n\nIn summary, in this post we've learned:\n\n 1. How data is generally siloed and sequestered within the corporate\n    environment, leading to a bevy of unnecessary steps on behalf of the analyst\n    in order to distill a functional report for the powers-that-be\n 2. Two major methods in which data comes from the data team (henceforth known\n    as the Dataratti) to your team: Dashboards and Business Intelligence\n    interfaces, and...\n 3. Assuming you get data in the form of dashboards, how to take these\n    dashboards, download the underlying data, recombine and manipulate the data,\n    and package it in a way acceptable for your needs.\n\nCongrats, you've just learned the crucial skill of the Slice n' Dice!\n\nQuite sleepily,\n\n-Snacks","html":"<p>In my last post, we discussed what separates a <em>true</em> analyst (read: technical) from a project manager wearing the mask of an analyst like some Scott Snyder era Joker (I figure that there's a solid overlap between fans of comic books and fans of the real world application of data.

This generally takes shape as either dashboards in a system like Tableau, <strong>or</strong> if your company has a group of particularly strong data/business analysts (or particularly weak programmers) an interface written in plain(enough) English on a Business Intelligence platform such as Microsoft BI/SAP Business Objects or whatever other system your company utilizes. As a fun little note, this team <strong>ALMOST ALWAYS</strong> is referred to by some sort of acronym such as QDAR! (Quality data and reporting!) or KMnR! (Knowledge management and reporting!) or Those Fucking Guys (who have something to do with reporting) (TFG(whstdwr)). On a less fun little note...neither you, nor seemingly ANYONE ELSE will have contact with this team. In light of this information, how do the reports that they build get chosen and who decides how these databases are built? The world may never know.</p><p>So let's assume the first type of reporting: the Dataratti  (which is how I will refer to the acronym defined team described above moving forward) produces dashboards utilizing a tool such as Tableau or Crystal Reports. You may be thinking to yourself: \"hey, isn't my job taking the data and putting it in a form where people who are scared by more than two nested groups of parenthesis, and thus this renders my job unnecessary?\" The answer to the question is twofold: Yes, and of course not! As mentioned previously, the decision to create these dashboards, the data contained therein, and how you want them to look is decided upon by a mythical creature who has full access and understanding of the data warehouse, AND has full access to and understanding of the stakeholders (AKA, <strong>Those Who Sit Above in Shadow</strong>; that's a reference from a famous run of Thor comics that refers to to a mysterious cabal of gods who perpetuate the cycle of Ragnarok in order to subsist upon the energies created by this strife...which as I write this, is an almost disgustingly on-the-nose metaphor for upper management). Now, if you believe that you may be this mythical creature (as I do), I <em>DARE</em> you to apply for a job with this job description, and once you clinch it with the advice from this blog,  rapidly realize that your job will involve either one of these job duties or the other.</p><p>With that digression, even if somehow a useful dashboard for YOU is created, the limitations inherent in these dashboarding tools make one CRUCIAL issue omnipresent: one can only effectively illustrate up to 16 different variables at a time before the system breaks down (for example, Tableau's documentation specifically warns against this). So even if you have the nicest, most illustrative dashboards on the planet from the Dataratti, there is a nearly 100% chance that the information that you actually need will be scattered across 2-3 different dashboards...rendering the nice looking dashboards essentially useless for your purposes, and as previously stated, you have no contact with the Dataratti, nor do you have access to the underlying data from which these dashboards are created. So pop quiz hot shot, what DO you do?</p><p>Well, mercifully, all of these dashboard tools allow an end user to download a \"data dump\" (our parlance for \"a buncha numbers with headings\"). Using Tableau as an example, one can download either a \"crosstab\" or a text file of the data represented by the dashboard (in both \"summary\" and \"full data\" format). Now, just to get the truly gifted in Tableau off my back, yes, the functionality does exist to build in the ability to download the data in the exact format necessary for <em>your</em> needs through a specific combination of custom web server views and Javascript, but...</p><ol><li>If the users of the dash are exclusively using this function, why do the dashboard at all? And...</li><li>This forces the developers in the Dataratti to have decent web design skills on top of really high level Tableau skills, and it requires someone to anticipate exactly how the data will be used by the end user by the Dataratti (which is incredibly hard as it's impossible to speak to this department directly, and as previously stated, the lack of <em>this</em> knowledge on their end is the entire reason why my department exists).</li></ol><p>A few things to note before downloading data from Tableau:</p><ul><li>You must highlight at least one element of the dashboard before downloading a crosstab.</li><li>Depending on what kind of dashboard you're working with, you may need to highlight the entirety of one column in order to capture the entirety of your data (<strong>click the first element in any column</strong> and then scroll down to the bottom of the report...which may be enormously long, <strong>hit shift</strong> and click the last element in the report) before downloading either the data or the crosstab.</li><li>If you are downloading a crosstab, be wary, Tableau web server caps how many rows you can download in this method at a time, this can be avoided by downloading the text version of the data (by clicking data as opposed to crosstab). HOWEVER...</li><li>If you are going the data route, it defaults to summary view. Look over all the headings, and ensure that this covers everything you need, otherwise click <strong>\"full data\"</strong>. Interestingly, this still isn't actually the entirety of your data, and continue to check to make sure all of your headings are covered, otherwise, click the <strong>display all columns</strong> box, and then download all the rows as a text file.</li></ul><p>Now, repeat these steps until all of the data that you need in <em>your</em> report is contained across these text files (.csv, AKA the Comma Separated Value file type). With all that lunacy completed, you now have several sheets with some common columns, but all with different information; only some of which you need, so what do you think you do?</p><p>Simple, you use the tools given to you in the previous posts: you <em>lookup</em> on the common factors across the sheets and return the data that you want until you have all the data you need, in the correct order, on one sheet, and then depending on the ask, you may want to pivot that data out in order to <em>summarize</em> the whole mess of data. <strong>THIS IS YOUR FINAL PRODUCT</strong> well done. Another protip: if you want to reposition data that you've obtained via a lookup, highlight the whole column, hit <strong>control+C</strong> to copy the data and then hit <strong>control+V</strong> pause a second (press NOTHING else) and then press <strong>control FOLLOWED by V</strong>. This takes the values generated by a formula and replaces them with the values obtained. Functionally, this <em>looks</em> exactly the same, but now you can move the data around without affecting or being affected by other data.</p><p>As explaining only one possible dirty data scenario took over 1500 words, next time, we'll discuss the other most common form of taking the dirty data from the Dataratti and making it useful to you: using business intelligence portals as opposed to dashboards in order to grab the data that you need. Also, if I don't get roasted on a spit for being half asleep for tomorrow's (today's?) meeting, I'll try and write up a companion post with an example of how this works out in practice.</p><p>In summary, in this post we've learned:</p><ol><li>How data is generally siloed and sequestered within the corporate environment, leading to a bevy of unnecessary steps on behalf of the analyst in order to distill a functional report for the powers-that-be</li><li>Two major methods in which data comes from the data team (henceforth known as the Dataratti) to your team: Dashboards and Business Intelligence interfaces, and...</li><li>Assuming you get data in the form of dashboards, how to take these dashboards, download the underlying data, recombine and manipulate the data, and package it in a way acceptable for your needs.</li></ol><p>Congrats, you've just learned the crucial skill of the <em>Slice n' Dice</em>!</p><p>Quite sleepily,</p><p>-Snacks</p>","url":"https://hackersandslackers.com/dealing-with-dirty-data-in-excel/","uuid":"4753f845-b70e-4159-9a45-90753b8620b4","page":false,"codeinjection_foot":"","codeinjection_head":"","comment_id":"5b0e56b16cb7ee206e3e518a"}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c12d7bfe875ad7bb8673660","title":"Using Gulp: Tasks to Make Frontend Tolerable","slug":"using-gulp-to-make-frontend-tolerable","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://hackersandslackers.com/content/images/2019/03/gulp-1.jpg","excerpt":"Optimize your frontend code with Gulp: the task runner to make you production-ready.","custom_excerpt":"Optimize your frontend code with Gulp: the task runner to make you production-ready.","created_at_pretty":"30 May, 2018","published_at_pretty":"30 May, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"28 March, 2019","created_at":"2018-05-29T23:28:01.000-04:00","published_at":"2018-05-30T12:40:20.000-04:00","updated_at":"2019-03-28T05:58:57.000-04:00","meta_title":"Using Gulp to Make Frontend Tolerable | Hackers and Slackers","meta_description":"Automate tasks for production deployment such as compiling your CSS and JS","og_description":"Optimize your frontend code with Gulp: the task runner to make you production-ready.","og_image":"https://hackersandslackers.com/content/images/2019/03/gulp-1.jpg","og_title":"Using Gulp to Make Frontend Tolerable","twitter_description":"Automate the lame stuff","twitter_image":"https://hackersandslackers.com/content/images/2019/03/gulp-1.jpg","twitter_title":"Using Gulp to Make Frontend Tolerable","authors":[{"name":"Todd Birchard","slug":"todd","bio":"Product manager turned engineer with an ongoing identity crisis.

Check out this post\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/upgrading-to-gulp-4/]  for Gulp >4.0.0\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPerhaps the whole obligatory-Gulp-tutorial on [Some Coding Blog] thing has\nbecome a bit cliché at this point. Haters may do as they will, but I 'll take\nany opportunity to jam as many SEO keywords I can get at this point. You know\nthe ones: Gulp, ExpressJS, NodeJS, or perhaps even React Vue frontend Ubuntu\nframework API social cloud data entrepreneur community. \n\nRegardless, we all need our own copy+paste references from time-to-time, or even\nworse: when we copy/paste our gulpfile.js from project to project and forget\nwhat they actually do. I won't tell anybody.\n\nQuick 101\nNodeJS developers use Gulp to automate necessary processes before moving their\nfrontend code to production. This includes minifying files to make them run\nfaster, and to also make them unreadable to people who would otherwise make fun\nof your mediocre Javascript which you were forced to crank out on a short\ntimeline.\n\nGeneral Workflow\nLet's say you're running a basic Express app. As opposed to developing and\nstoring files in a directory such as /public, Gulp enables us to develop in one\ndirectory, and compile to another. That means we can keep our horrible\nuncompressed and uncompiled  source in a folder such as /src, and output them to\na directory such as /dist, which would be our public-facing output. An Express\nfile structure utilizing this would look something like this:\n\n  |- src/\n      |- js/ \n      |- scss/\n  |- dist/\n      |- js/ \n      |- css/\n      |- img/\n      |- fonts/\n  |- views\n      |- index.hbs\n  |- routes\n      |- index.js\n  |- gulpfile.js\n  |- node_modules/\n  |- package.json\n  |- app.js\n\n\nInstallation\nFirst install the gulp CLI:\n\nnpm install --global gulp-cli\n\n\nNext, enter your project folder and install gulp while saving it as  a project\ndependency.\n\nnpm install --save gulp\n\n\nHow it Works\nGulp doesn't do much on its own; the true magic lies within its vast library of\nplugins. Each individual plugin typically covers a simple task, such as\ncompiling LESS or SASS files, or minifying client-side JavaScript and CSS. The\nlimited scope of plugins entails a bit of setup in our gulpfile to chain said\ntasks together, but it also makes Gulp highly customizable to cater to your\nspecific needs.\n\nThe Gulpfile\nGulp works by invoking a file called gulpfile.js in your main directory, which\nyou'll need to create and set up yourself (sorry). The file is divided into two\nmain parts: requiring (importing) plugins, and defining which tasks to run when\ngulp is invoked. A basic worthless gulpfile might look something like:\n\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\n\ngulp.task('default', function () {\n  console.log('Sup World!');\n});\n\n\nTo make this file useful, we'll need to install more plugins and set up tasks\nfor them.\n\nEssential Plugins\nLet's look at what each one does. Keep in mind there are thousands of Gulp\nplugins, so let's just touch on the big hitters here.\n\nKeep in mind to install any of these plugins, you'll simply need to run the npm\ninstallation in your project directory:\n\nnpm install --save [plugin name]\n\n\ngulp-uglify\nMinifies Javascript or CSS files, and outputs the result into the directory of\nyour choice. This plugin can be reused across filetypes, as we'll demonstrate in\na moment.\n\ngulp-concat\nCombines minified files into a single file. This is essential for browser\nperformance as it reduces the number of http requests being made every time your\npage loads.\n\ngulp-rename\nRenames files (such as those produced by gulp-concat).\n\ngulp-sass / gulp-less\nCompiles your Sass or Less files into CSS and outputs to the directory of your\nchoice.\n\ngulp-minify-css\nMinifies CSS, as you might imagine. This can chained to gulp-sass or gulp-less\nto minify the CSS files those tasks produce.\n\ngulp-autoprefixer\nThank god for this. Autoprefixer finds CSS styles and adds the browser-specific\nequivalents to your CSS, so you don't need to write the same style 10 times for\nevery horrible browser in existence. This means you can write styles such as:\n\nbackground: linear-gradient(to bottom, white, black);\n\n\nAnd have them output as:\n\nbackground: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, from(white), to(black));\nbackground: -webkit-linear-gradient(top, white, black);\nbackground: -o-linear-gradient(top, white, black);\nbackground: linear-gradient(to bottom, white, black);\n\n\ngulp-watch\nAllows Gulp to listen for changes being made to source files, so that it may\nfire an event upon file change, such as:\n\ngulp-livereload\nCompiles the changes made in directories being watched via gulp-watch\nautomatically while you work.\n\nNext Level Pro Shit\nWhile these plugins aren't 'essential', they are really cool and helpful.\n\ngulp-sourcemaps\nAn obnoxious side effect of minifying and concating your files is when it comes\ntime to debug errors on the frontend. Errors occurring at \"line 235\" are pretty\nuseless considering your error codes are referring to the compiled files,\nwithout granting a hint as to where the problematic code may have come from in\nthe first place. gulp-sourcemaps resolves this by adding commenting paths to\nwhich source files your code originated from.\n\ngulp-browser-sync\nBy leveraging BrowserSync [https://browsersync.io/], this plugin immediately\nrefreshes an open browser which links to files just changed by gulp. This means\nyou can code, compile, and see the results in real time. This takes a bit extra\neffort to set up, so be sure to check their documentation\n[https://browsersync.io/docs].\n\ngulp-load-plugins\nNormally when creating our gulpfile, we need to start off by requiring our\nplugins via something like this:\n\nvar gulp = require('gulp'),\n    del = require('del'),\n    concat = require('gulp-concat'),\n    rename = require('gulp-rename'),\n    uglify = require('gulp-uglify'),\n    sass = require('gulp-sass'),\n    watch = require('gulp-watch'),\n    livereload = require('gulp-livereload'),\n    minifyCss = require('gulp-minify-css'),\n    autoprefixer = require('gulp-autoprefixer');\n\n\ngulp-load-plugins  instead checks your package.json for any Gulp plugins and\nimmediately requires them, thus saving you a few precious minutes. The output\ninstead looks like:\n\nvar $ = require('gulp-load-plugins')();\n\n\nBuilding The Gulpfile\nNow that we have all these dope plugins, we can finally build our gulpfile.\nHere's an example (without using gulp-load-plugins  for now):\n\nvar gulp = require('gulp'),\n    del = require('del'),\n    concat = require('gulp-concat'),\n    rename = require('gulp-rename'),\n    uglify = require('gulp-uglify'),\n    sass = require('gulp-sass'),\n    watch = require('gulp-watch'),\n    livereload = require('gulp-livereload'),\n    minifyCss = require('gulp-minify-css'),\n    autoprefixer = require('gulp-autoprefixer');\n\ngulp.task('styles', function() {\n    return gulp.src('src/sass/*.scss')\n        .pipe(sass({outputStyle: 'expanded', unix_newlines: true, linefeed: \"lf\"}).on('error', sass.logError))\n        .pipe(autoprefixer())\n        .pipe(minifyCss({\n            keepSpecialComments: 1\n        }))\n        .pipe(rename(\"theme.min.css\"))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('./assets/css/'));\n});\n\n\ngulp.task('scripts', function() {\n    return gulp.src(['src/js/plugin/*.js', 'src/js/base.js'])\n        .pipe(uglify())\n        .pipe(concat('theme.min.js'))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('assets/js'));\n});\n\n\ngulp.task('ghost_config', ['scripts'], function() {\n    return gulp.src(['src/js/config.js', 'assets/js/theme.min.js'])\n        .pipe(concat('theme.min.js'))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('assets/js'));\n});\n\n\ngulp.task('default', function() {\n    gulp.start('styles', 'scripts', 'ghost_config', 'watch');\n});\n\n\ngulp.task('watch', function() {\n    gulp.watch('src/sass/*.scss', ['styles']);\n    gulp.watch('src/js/*.js', ['scripts', 'ghost_config']);\n    livereload.listen();\n    gulp.watch(['*']).on('change', livereload.changed);\n});\n\n\n\nJust by looking at the file itself, you may be able to dissect what's happening.\nAfter we require our plugins, we define our tasks,  which are essentially\nindividual jobs consisting of one or more gulp plugins depending on how you've\nchained them.\n\nHere's the general terminology to help clear things up:\n\n * gulp.task: Defines a task consisting of one of more plugin actions.\n * gulp.src:  Specifies the folder containing source files.\n * gulp.dest: Defines the folder to output compiled files to.\n * pipe(): Allows multiple events to be chained together in a single task.\n\nWrapping up\nOnce your file is ready to go, simply run the grunt  command in your project\ndirectory. You should see Gulp output the status of each task you've set, as\nwell as any errors which may have occurred.\n\nIn short, just use Gulp. The scientific community has come to a consensus that\nGulp is objectively superior to its counterpart, Grunt. Ask Matt, he's a\nscientist.\n\nPeace fam!","html":"<p><em><strong>NOTE</strong>:  This tutorial was written for Gulp versions &lt;4.0.0.

The output instead looks like:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var $ = require('gulp-load-plugins')();\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id=\"building-the-gulpfile\">Building The Gulpfile</h2><p>Now that we have all these dope plugins, we can finally build our gulpfile. Here's an example (without using <strong>gulp-load-plugins</strong> for now):</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var gulp = require('gulp'),\n    del = require('del'),\n    concat = require('gulp-concat'),\n    rename = require('gulp-rename'),\n    uglify = require('gulp-uglify'),\n    sass = require('gulp-sass'),\n    watch = require('gulp-watch'),\n    livereload = require('gulp-livereload'),\n    minifyCss = require('gulp-minify-css'),\n    autoprefixer = require('gulp-autoprefixer');\n\ngulp.task('styles', function() {\n    return gulp.src('src/sass/*.scss')\n        .pipe(sass({outputStyle: 'expanded', unix_newlines: true, linefeed: &quot;lf&quot;}).on('error', sass.logError))\n        .pipe(autoprefixer())\n        .pipe(minifyCss({\n            keepSpecialComments: 1\n        }))\n        .pipe(rename(&quot;theme.min.css&quot;))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('./assets/css/'));\n});\n\n\ngulp.task('scripts', function() {\n    return gulp.src(['src/js/plugin/*.js', 'src/js/base.js'])\n        .pipe(uglify())\n        .pipe(concat('theme.min.js'))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('assets/js'));\n});\n\n\ngulp.task('ghost_config', ['scripts'], function() {\n    return gulp.src(['src/js/config.js', 'assets/js/theme.min.js'])\n        .pipe(concat('theme.min.js'))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('assets/js'));\n});\n\n\ngulp.task('default', function() {\n    gulp.start('styles', 'scripts', 'ghost_config', 'watch');\n});\n\n\ngulp.task('watch', function() {\n    gulp.watch('src/sass/*.scss', ['styles']);\n    gulp.watch('src/js/*.js', ['scripts', 'ghost_config']);\n    livereload.listen();\n    gulp.watch(['*']).on('change', livereload.changed);\n});\n\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Just by looking at the file itself, you may be able to dissect what's happening. After we require our plugins, we define our <em>tasks,</em> which are essentially individual jobs consisting of one or more gulp plugins depending on how you've chained them.</p><p>Here's the general terminology to help clear things up:</p><ul><li><strong>gulp.task</strong>: Defines a task consisting of one of more plugin actions.</li><li><strong>gulp.src</strong>:  Specifies the folder containing source files.</li><li><strong>gulp.dest</strong>: Defines the folder to output compiled files to.</li><li><strong>pipe()</strong>: Allows multiple events to be chained together in a single task.</li></ul><h2 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping up</h2><p>Once your file is ready to go, simply run the <strong>grunt</strong> command in your project directory. You should see Gulp output the status of each task you've set, as well as any errors which may have occurred.</p><p>In short, just use Gulp. The scientific community has come to a consensus that Gulp is objectively superior to its counterpart, Grunt. Ask Matt, he's a scientist.</p><p>Peace fam!</p>","url":"https://hackersandslackers.com/using-gulp-to-make-frontend-tolerable/","uuid":"f0ec0903-cd67-4663-b872-9ecdf9ffc557","page":false,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"comment_id":"5b0e1a41e88ecf2fbeb3f5fa"}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c12d7bfe875ad7bb867365f","title":"Doing the Excel Data Dance","slug":"doing-the-excel-data-dance","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://hackersandslackers.com/content/images/2018/05/maxexcel4@2x.jpg","excerpt":"Taking a step back to reflect on the problems Excel intends to solve.","custom_excerpt":"Taking a step back to reflect on the problems Excel intends to solve.","created_at_pretty":"29 May, 2018","published_at_pretty":"29 May, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"21 January, 2019","created_at":"2018-05-28T22:07:04.000-04:00","published_at":"2018-05-29T08:00:00.000-04:00","updated_at":"2019-01-21T14:27:30.000-05:00","meta_title":"Doing the Excel Data Dance | Hackers and Slackers","meta_description":"Taking a step back to reflect on the problems Excel intends to solve","og_description":"Taking a step back to reflect on the problems Excel intends to solve","og_image":"https://hackersandslackers.com/content/images/2018/05/maxexcel4@2x.jpg","og_title":"Doing the Excel Data Dance","twitter_description":"Taking a step back to reflect on the problems Excel intends to solve","twitter_image":"https://hackersandslackers.com/content/images/2018/05/maxexcel4@2x.jpg","twitter_title":"Doing the Excel Data Dance","authors":[{"name":"Max Mileaf","slug":"snacks","bio":"One of three therapists in the known universe who knows how to use a computer.
