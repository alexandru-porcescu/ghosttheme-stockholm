That's where Jupyter Lab comes in.\n\nWhy JupyterLab?\nJupyterLab is sometimes referred to as \"the next generation of Jupyter\nnotebooks,\" which is a statement I can attest to. JupyterLab offers an improved\ninterface for Jupyter notebooks which is both available out of the box, as well\nas highly customizable for your workflow.\n\nOut of the box, the traditional Jupyter interface is extended to include a tree\nfile manager: similar to what you might expect from an IDE. This allows you to\neasily browse all  available notebooks on your server. In addition, the notebook\ninterface has been simplified to reduce noise brought on by (mostly useless)\ntoolbars and excessive buttons. Take a look at the interface prior to any\ncustomization:\n\nEven more appealing than an updated interface is JupyterLab's openness to \ncustomization. JupyterLab has a strongly growing ecosystem for extension\ndevelopment: we'll be getting a taste of some of those goodies in just a moment.\n\nGetting Started\nIf you're starting from scratch, go ahead and follow the same steps in the \nJupyter Notebook setup tutorial\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/running-jupyter-notebooks-on-a-ubuntu-server/] \nup until Conda is set up and activated. \n\nWith a Ubuntu server prepped and ready, install Jupyter Lab with the following\ncommand:\n\n$ conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab\n\n\nBefore we go any further, make sure you're tunneled into your server - we need\nto do this in order to launch notebooks, remember?:\n\n$ ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 myuser@your_server_ip\n\n\nStart up the Jupyter Lab environment like this:\n\n$ conda activate your_env\n$ jupyter lab\n\n\nIf everything went well, you should be greeted with a fancy Jupyter Lab loading\nscreen and then thrown into the Jupyer Lab environment.\n\nHome sweet home.Things are looking good right off the bat. Without any added\nlibraries, we've already beefed up our Jupyter Notebook workspace. The tree view\nis available, we can launch terminals, and don't forget: we can split screen by\ndragging snapping windows where we see fit. \n\nCustomizing Your Workspace\nJupyterLab uses NodeJS to enable some of its cooler functionality and\nextensions.  Go ahead and install Node:\n\n$ cd /tmp\n$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -\n$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nNice!
