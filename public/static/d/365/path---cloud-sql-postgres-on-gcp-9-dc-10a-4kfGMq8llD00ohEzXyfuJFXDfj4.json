I've been maintaining an affair with\ntwo lovers. That's right; they're none other than PostgreSQL, and Google Cloud.\nWhile such polygamy may be shunned by the masses, I believe that somehow, some\nway, we can just make this ménage à trois work. What entices me about Cloud SQL\nis the existence of the Cloud SQL API\n[https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/admin-api/]  , which generates\npredictable REST endpoints for presumably reading and writing to your database.\nPlease allow a moment of silence for the old workflow of API Gateways and Lambda\nfunctions. RIP.\n\nWe’ll get to APIs eventually, but for now we have one glaring obstacle: creating\nour DB, and connecting to it in a way vaguely resembles something secure*.\n\nNote: today may or may not be opposite day.Creating Our Cloud Database\nHit up the Cloud SQL [https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/]  section of your\nconsole to get this party started. Database creation on GCP is surprisingly\neasy.\n\nThat's pretty much it tbh.Databases Gone Wild: Postgres Exposed\nThere are plenty of correct ways to connect to your Postgres database correctly\nand securely. You can set up SSL for an IP\n[https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/connect-admin-ip], connect using a\nproxy [https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/connect-admin-proxy], or even\nvia internal cloud functions\n[https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/connect-cloud-functions]. You may\nwant to consider doing one of those things. I'll be doing this a different way,\nbecause I'd rather get my useless data on a hackable public database than\nrewrite Google tutorials:\n\nDo as I say, not as I do.This is where you can feel free to go ahead and\npopulate data into your DB via whichever GUI you'd prefer. It'll be easier to\nsee which API calls work if there's actual data involved.\n\nPick whichever overpriced client suits you best!Enabling the API\nAs always with GCP, we need to explicitly activate the API for SQL; that way,\nthey can charge us money forever, long after we've forgotten this tutorial. We\ncan do this here\n[https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=sqladmin]. Are you\nstarting to feel excited? I know I am; just think, all those API calls right\naround the corner, coming from a real SQL database. Wow. \n\nIn the overall process, we've made it here: the part where we run into OAuth2:\n\nRefresh tokens? Scopes? Uh oh.I'll admit it took me a good amount of time to\ndecrypt the information which failed to conveyed here. After clicking into every\nrelated link and failing at attempts to hit the API via Postman, the bad vibes\nstarted kicking in. What if this isn't the dream after all? To spare you the\nprocess, let me introduce you to a very useful GCP tool.\n\nGoogle API Explorer\nGoogle's API explorer is a GUI for playing with any API, connected to any of\nyour services. This is a cool way to preview what the exact scope of an API is\nbefore you sign up for it. Better yet, you can use placeholder User_IDs  and \nUser_Secrets  since this is basically just a sandbox.\n\nInteractive API learning tools beat reading documentation any day.After\nselecting an 'endpoint' and specifying some details like your project and\ndatabase instance, you can immediately see (theoretical) results of what the\nlive API can do. This is very useful, but I'm afraid this is where things get\ndark.\n\nHello Darkness My Old Friend\nYou may have noticed a lot of similar words or phrases popping up in these\nendpoints. Words such as \"admin\"  and \"list\", while lacking phrases such as \n\"show me my god damn data\". Google's Cloud SQL API  is NOT, in fact, an API to\ninteract with your data, but rather an admin API which enables you to do things\nprobably better suited for, you know, admin consoles.\n\nAs a big fan of GCP, this is but one of a number of growing pains I've\nexperienced with the platform so far. For instance, this entire blog along with\nits VPC has temporary deleted today, because apparently the phrases \"remove my\nproject from Firebase\"  and \"delete my project along with everything I love\" are\nsentimentally similar enough to leave that language vague and awkward.\n\nWhere Do We Go From Here?\nTo reiterate, the problem we were originally looking to solve was to find a\nservice which could (after what, 30 years?) make relational database reading and\nwriting trivial, especially in the case of apps which are simply themes without\na configurable backend, such as this blog.\n\nMongoDB Atlas  is an organizational mess which can't even describe their own\nproduct. Firebase  has yet to implement an import feature, so unless you feel\nlike writing loops to write to an experimental NoSQL database (I don't), we're\nstill kind of screwed. I know there are guys like Dreamfactory out there, but\nthese services are the sketchy ones who email you every day just for looking at\na trial. Also, anything related to Oracle or running on Oracle products (by\nchoice) sucks. There, I said it. Java developers will probably be too bust with\ngarbage collection and getting sued to argue with me anyway.\n\nAll that said, it feels like the \"Backend as a service\" thing is looming over\nthe horizon. There just doesn't seem to be anybody who's executed this\neffectively yet.\n\nUPDATE:  As it turns out, there is a service out there that accomplishes\neverything we hoped to achieve in Google cloud, and it is called Apisentris\n[https://apisentris.com/]. It's awesome, it's free, and the guy behind it is a\nchill dude.","html":"<p>Well folks, I have a confession to make. I've been maintaining an affair with two lovers.
