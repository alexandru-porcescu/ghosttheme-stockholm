Starting with\nfamiliar names like MySQL,  Oracle, and Postgres,  the concept of maintaining\nmultiple -related- tables of data are the bare minimum technology stack for any\ncompany, regardless of what said company does.\n\nWhile our example of Datasets #1 and #2  can be thought of as isolated tables,\nthe process of 'joining' them (in SQL terms) or 'merging' them (in Pandas terms) \n is  trivial. What's more, we can do far more than with JOINS (or merges) than\nsimply combining our data into a single set.\n\nEnter The Panda\nPython happens to have an obscenely popular library for performing SQL-like\nlogic, dubbed Pandas. If it remains unclear as to what Pandas is, just remember:\n Databases are basically Excel spreadsheets are basically an interface for\nPandas. The technicality of that explanation may be horrendous to those who\nunderstand the differences, but the fundamental truth remains: we're dealing\nwith information, inside of cells, on a two-dimensional grid. When you hear the\nnext idiot spew a catch phrase like \"data is the new oil\", the \"data\" they're\nreferring to is akin to that sick Excel sheet you made at work.\n\nScenario: Finding Mismatches in Data\nThis scenario actually stems from a real-life example which, sure enough, was my\nfirst encounter with Pandas. One could argue I owe much 0f my data career to a\n3am Google Hangout with Snkia.\n\nIn our scenario, our company has signed up for a very expensive software product\nwhich charges by individual license. To our surprise, the number of licenses for\nthis software totaled over 1000  seats!  After giving this data a quick glance,\nhowever, it's clear that many of these employees have actually been terminated,\nthus resulting in unspeakable loss in revenue. \n\nThe good news is we have another dataset called active employees (aka: employees\nwhich have not been terminated... yet). So, how do we use these two sets of data\nto determine which software licenses are valid? First, let's look at the types \nof ways we can merge data in Pandas.\n\nTerminology\nMERGE\nSets of data can be merged in a number of ways. Merges can either be used to\nfind similarities in two Dataframes and merge associated information, or may be\nentirely non-destructive in the way that two sets of data are merged.\n\nKEY\nIn many cases (such as the one in this tutorial) you'd likely want to merge two\nDataframes based on the value of a key. A key is the authoritative column by\nwhich the Dataframes will be merged. When merging Dataframes in this way, keys\nwill stay in tact as an identifier while the values of columns in the same row\nassociated to that key.\n\nThis type of merge can be used when two Dataframes hold differing fields for\nsimilar rows. If Dataframe 1 contains the phone numbers of customers by name,\nand Dataframe 2 contains emails of a similar grouping of people, these two may\nbe merged to create a single collection of data with all of this information.\n\nAXIS\nA parameter of pandas functions which determines whether the function should be\nrun against a Dataframe's columns or rows. An axis of 0 determines that the\naction will be taken on a per-row basis, where an axis of 1 denotes column.\n\nFor example, performing a drop with axis 0 on key X will drop the row where\nvalue of a cell is equal to X.\n\nLEFT/RIGHT MERGE\nAn example of a left/right merge can be seen below:\n\nJoin on keys found in left Dataframe.The two data frames above hold similar keys\nwith different associated information per axis, thus the result is a combination\nof these two Dataframes where the keys remain intact.\n\n\"Left\" or \"right\" refer to the left or right Dataframes above. If the keys from\nboth Dataframes do not match 1-to-1, specifying a left/right merge determines\nwhich Dataframe's keys will be considered the authority to be preserved in the\nmerge.\n\nJoin on keys found in right Dataframe.INNER MERGE\nAn inner merge will merge two Dataframes based on overlap of values between keys\nin both Dataframes:\n\nJoin on keys found in right Dataframe.OUTER MERGE\nAn outer merge will preserve the most data by not dropping keys which are\nuncommon to both Dataframes. Keys which exist in a single Dataframe will be\nadded to the resulting Dataframe, with empty values populated for any columns\nbrought in by the other Dataframe:\n\nBack to our Scenario: Merging Two Dataframes via Left Merge\nLet's get it going. Enter the iPython shell.\n\nImport Pandas and read both of your CSV files.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"csv1.csv\")  \ndf2 = pd.read_csv(\"csv2.csv\")\n\n\nThe above opens the CSVs as Dataframes recognizable by pandas.\nNext, we'll merge the two CSV files.\n\nHow  specifies the type of merge, and on  specifies the column to merge by\n(key). The key must be present in both Dataframes.\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise we'll be merging left, as that is the CSV which\ncontains the keys we'd like to maintain.\n\nmergedDF = df2.merge(df, how=“left”, on=\"email\")\n\nprint(mergedDF)\n\n\nThis should return a dataset of all common rows, with columns from both CSVs\nincluded in the merge.\n\nScenario 2: Missing Data\nBefore we go, let's toss in another scenario for good measure.\n\nThis time around we have two datasets which should actually probably be a single\ndataset. Dataset #1  contains all customers once again, but for some reason, \nDataset #1  contains email address where set Dataset #2  does not. Similarly, \nDataset #2  contains addresses which are  missing in Dataset #1. We assume there\nis no reason to keep these sets of data isolated other than human error.\n\nIn the case where we are confident that employees exist in both datasets but\ncontain different information, performing an inner  merge will join these two\nsets by a key such as customer ID or email. If all goes well, the final dataset\nshould equal the same number of rows found in both Datasets #1 and #2.\n\nDocumentation\nFor more on merging, check out the official Pandas documentation here\n[https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/merging.html].","html":"<style>\n    img {\n        border: 0 !important;\n    }\n </style>   <p>Let's say you have two obscenely large sets of data. </p><p>These sets of data contain information on a similar topic, such as customers. <strong>Dataset #1 </strong>might contain a high-level view of all customers of a business, while <strong>Datatset #2</strong> contains a lifetime history of orders for a company.
