People with cooler jobs\nprobably have that moment when they save their first patient or launch their\nfirst rocket. For me, the idea of building an API was this moment in software\ndevelopment. All those past black boxes which spat out results your life\ndepended on: we can make those now.\n\nFeel free to remain unfazed by this as I'm sure most are... for those of us who\ncan't remember how they became an \"engineer\" in the first place, API design\nfeels like reaching a final frontier. Granted, this may happen at least 20 more\ntimes in your software career, so don’t pause too long now.\n\nIf you managed to catch the tutorial on setting up RDS on AWS\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/setting-up-mysql-on-aws/], you're already a step\nahead. We're going to make our way through this slowly, which is probably a good\nidea even if you've done this before. There are so many pitfalls and nuances in\nAWS's architecture that I'm not even sure I fully understand what's happening,\neven when everything works.\n\nQuick Overview\nHere are the services we'll be using to hook this baby up:\n\n *   RDS:  Amazon's cloud-hosted relational databases. These databases come\n   preconfigured with an endpoint, which can be made accessible to other AWS\n   services or even to external manipulation. \n *   Lambda:  Snippets of code which can be invoked without setting up a web\n   server (hence: \"serverless\"). Lambda functions are intended to serve simple,\n   specific functions (such as serving as the logic for an endpoint, for\n   instance). Lambda functions play well with other AWS services: we'll be using\n   this as the glue between our API and interacting with the Database.\n *   API Gateway:  Amazon's visual editor for creating an API. API Gateway\n   allows developers to architect the structure and logic of APIs without having\n   to worry about setting up routes via code.\n *   IAM:  Amazon's headache of a user & permissions manager. IAM is needed to\n   specify exactly with AWS services have access to other services, which users\n   are permitted to interact with your API, etc. \n\nGameplan\nSo here's the deal. Our RDS  database will be where all the data we provide and\nreceive will live. Lambda  functions will be the snippets of code actually\ninteracting with information from the database; all of our queries will be done\nthrough Lambda. API Gateway  will control the \"design\" of the API, as in the\nstructure of endpoints, their respective methods, and how all these should\ninteract with Lambda.\n\nIt sounds simple enough, but the devil is in the details. And trust me, there\nare a lot of details.\n\nSetting the Correct Role Permissions\nUsually, I'd say we should jump into the fun stuff and deal with the details\nwhen we get to them. I won't let you steer down that road with AWS... let's\navoid smashing our heads on keyboards where possible and kick things off slow.\n\nIf you were to attempt to create a Lambda function off the bat, the first prompt\nto appear would demand a \"role\" to be specified. Roles are one of the types of\npermission packages (?) we mentioned earlier. Roles limit exactly which services\nyour Lambda function can interact with off the bat. Start with the wrong role,\nand you won't be able to do much of anything.\n\nHead over the IAM console\n[https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/home]  to set up an\nappropriate role:\n\nWhat a God-awful way to handle permissions.Let's pause for a moment to take this\nall in. You'll see we have users, groups, roles, policies and a whole bunch of\nother garbage. Policies can be attached to roles. Policies can also be attached\nto users, and also attached to groups. Users can be in groups. Wait, so what if\na user has a bunch of policies, but then joins a group with a bunch of policies?\nWhat even is a \"policy\"? These are the real questions. The short answer is none\nof it makes sense; it's just extra job security for those who make it work.\n\nClick on \"Roles\" in the sidebar. Create a role. Select \"Lambda\" and click next.\n\nThis interface only seems to get worse.Ok cool. The role  we're creating is basically just going to be a collection of\npermissions we can attached directly to the role. Go ahead and attach these:\n\n * AmazonVPCFullAccess\n * AmazonAPIGatewayInvokeFullAccess\n * AmazonRDSFullAccess\n * AWSLambdaFullAccess\n * CloudWatchLogsFullAccess\n\nSave the role, and remember what you name it. You'll need it.\n\nGetting Started with Lambda Functions\nGo back to the Lambda console. It's game time. We're going to create a function\nfrom scratch (sadly, I haven't found any of the blueprints to be very useful\njust yet).\n\nIgnore Amazon's silly Blueprints.Under “runtime”, you’ll need to pick which\nprogramming language we’ll be writing our function in. I’m doing Python 3\nbecause I don’t mess with semicolons, ya dig. Most people seem to stick with\nNode, which makes sense: Node is much faster at runtime, especially when you\nconsider that AWS runs Node natively. The choice is your preference.\n\nAha, see the “Role” dropdown? This is what I warned you about. Select the role\nyou just created earlier from existing roles.\n\nLambda Function Editor\nWelcome to Lambda's web UIBehold, the Lambda visual editor. That tree you're\nseeing is a representation of the integration this function will handle. The\ncurrent function is the box top-middle, the trigger is on the left, and the list\nof potential AWS services we can touch is on the right; these were automatically\npopulated by that role I forced you to create. You're welcome.\n\nNOTE:  The entire interface below this section depends on which service you've\nclicked in the tree. It's not the most intuitive at first. I have my Lambda\nfunction selected, so that's the interface I can interact with below.\n\nInline Code Editor\nWe can create Lambdas directly in the browser, or by uploading souce via zip\nfile.Real quick, we need to go over what each field here does. The dropdown\ncurrently set to \"edit code inline\" can be expanded, which gives you the option\nto upload a zip file of source code. THIS WILL DELETE ALL PREEXISTING WORK. \nThey don't tell you that, hah. Ha hah. I recommend doing everything offline to\nbe uploaded later - this needs to be done with python packages anyway.\n\nHandler  specifies which function should be called upon initialization.\n\"lambda_function\" is referring to the function, so \"handler\" here specifies that\nthe function handler within lambda_function.py  is what will get called upon\nexecution.\n\nOur Lambda’s VPC Settings\nScroll down until you hit this pretty little gem:\n\nAWS is filled with complicated network concepts, and zero attempts to explain\nthem.We need to specify the VPC this function will interact with. If you created\nan RDS already, go ahead select the VPC you created. Add a bunch of subnets\n(whichever ones). Finally, select a security group. Remember that the\npermissions of this group determine whether or not your VPC is allowed to speak\nto this function. If you're struggling with this, check out the AWS MySQL post\nagain. I'm not going to link it twice in one post, sorry. I have self-respect\nyou know.\n\nThat's Enough For Now\nThere's a lot to take in when playing around in AWS. The combination of\ngibberish terminology and horrible documentation doesn't exactly make for solid\nuser experience. If you're new to AWS and any of this seems frustrating, know\nit's supposed to be. Amazon owns you, and they hate you. Kind of like God.\n\nI'd suggest messing around the interface, and maybe even check out API Gateway a\nbit to get a feel for how that stuff looks. They set you up with a cute demo to\nmake you think it's going to be easy, so maybe you'll enjoy that. Next time,\nwe're going to crank out some Lambdas.","html":"<p>There comes a surreal moment in nearly every profession in which perspective violently forces itself into our self-awareness. People with cooler jobs probably have that moment when they save their first patient or launch their first rocket. For me, the idea of building an API was this moment in software development. All those past black boxes which spat out results your life depended on: we can make those now.</p><p>Feel free to remain unfazed by this as I'm sure most are... for those of us who can't remember how they became an \"engineer\" in the first place, API design feels like reaching a final frontier. Granted, this may happen at least 20 more times in your software career, so don’t pause too long now.</p><p>If you managed to catch the tutorial on <a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/setting-up-mysql-on-aws/\">setting up RDS on AWS</a>, you're already a step ahead. We're going to make our way through this slowly, which is probably a good idea even if you've done this before. There are so many pitfalls and nuances in AWS's architecture that I'm not even sure I fully understand what's happening, even when everything works.</p><h2 id=\"quick-overview\">Quick Overview</h2><p>Here are the services we'll be using to hook this baby up:</p><ul><li> <strong>RDS:</strong> Amazon's cloud-hosted relational databases. These databases come preconfigured with an endpoint, which can be made accessible to other AWS services or even to external manipulation. </li><li> <strong>Lambda:</strong> Snippets of code which can be invoked without setting up a web server (hence: \"<em>serverless</em>\"). Lambda functions are intended to serve simple, specific functions (such as serving as the logic for an endpoint, for instance). Lambda functions play well with other AWS services: we'll be using this as the glue between our API and interacting with the Database.</li><li> <strong>API Gateway:</strong> Amazon's visual editor for creating an API. API Gateway allows developers to architect the structure and logic of APIs without having to worry about setting up routes via code.</li><li> <strong>IAM:</strong> Amazon's headache of a user &amp; permissions manager. IAM is needed to specify exactly with AWS services have access to other services, which users are permitted to interact with your API, etc. </li></ul><h3 id=\"gameplan\">Gameplan</h3><p>So here's the deal. Our <strong>RDS</strong> database will be where all the data we provide and receive will live. <strong>Lambda</strong> functions will be the snippets of code actually interacting with information from the database; all of our queries will be done through Lambda. <strong>API Gateway</strong> will control the \"design\" of the API, as in the structure of endpoints, their respective methods, and how all these should interact with Lambda.</p><p>It sounds simple enough, but the devil is in the details. And trust me, there are a lot of details.</p><h2 id=\"setting-the-correct-role-permissions\">Setting the Correct Role Permissions</h2><p>Usually, I'd say we should jump into the fun stuff and deal with the details when we get to them. I won't let you steer down that road with AWS... let's avoid smashing our heads on keyboards where possible and kick things off slow.</p><p>If you were to attempt to create a Lambda function off the bat, the first prompt to appear would demand a \"<strong>role</strong>\" to be specified.

Stepping stones such as these can serve as great turning points in a\ncareer, but they also expose how little we still know. For instance, when we\nintegrated the functional logic of APIs on the client side, we actually broke a\ncardinal rule: storing and passing private keys on the client side like an\nidiot. Does that make everything we learned useless? Not entirely, but kinda\nyeah.\n\nToday we'll do the equivalent in Python by using the requests  library. Requests\nis successor to Urllib, both of which are simple tools to retrieve or modify\ninformation on the web, most commonly in the case of APIs.\n\nWe'll be using JIRA's API as an example of how to format GET and POST requests.\nJIRA's API in particular is an excellent example of a powerful and useful API.\nThere's a ton we can do, thus a perfect demonstration of how much power one\nlibrary can give you.\n\nBatteries Not Included\nEven I sometimes forget that requests is not a built-in Python library. Make\nsure requests  is installed in your environment via pip install requests.\n\nCreate a file in your directory called creds.py  to store your credentials. Make\nsure to add that file to your .gitignore  if you plan on committing anything any\ntime soon.\n\n# creds.py\nusername = fake.user\npassword = securepassword123\n\n\nThe only libraries we need to import are requests  and json. Make sure you\nimport your credentials from the file you created earlier.\n\nimport requests\nimport json\nfrom creds import username, password\n\n\nGET Requests\nAs long as you have a URL, you can make a GET request. The requests library will\nreturn the content of any page it hits; if you make a request to an HTML page,\nyour response will be that page's HTML source.\n\nWhen we know what sort of data we're expecting to receive back, we can specify\nthe expected content type  by passing the headers  argument, and specifying the \nContent-Type. Authentication is handled via passing arguments as well,\nspecifically the auth  argument. Take a look at what you can pass in a GET\nrequest:\n\nCommon GET Arguments\n * url:  The URL we will either retrieve or pass the information along to.\n * parameters  (optional):  Depending on the API, some URLs can accept a\n   dictionary of variables to be passed along with the URL. These are called\n   query strings; you notice these all the time whenever you come across a URL\n   that looks like nonsense... that nonsense is information!\n * headers  (optional): A collection of metadata sent along with the request.\n   Our browsers send HTTP headers every time we visit a site, but the scope of\n   what a header value might cover ranges from tokens to content types.\n * auth  (optional):  Method for logging in if needed. Basic/Digest/Custom HTTP\n   Auth.\n\nLet’s GET Some\nWe're going to make a relatively simple request to pull open tickets from a JIRA\nproject called EXM.\n\nThis request will:\n\n * Accept our destination's base URL\n * Append 'search/' (the endpoint for searching issues)\n * Pass two parameters:  A query to return issues A flag to show the issue\n   history\n * Authenticate with our username/password\n * Print the result\n\nimport requests\nimport json\nfrom creds import username\nfrom creds import password\n\nbase_url = 'https://examplejira.com/rest/api/2/'\nheaders = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}\nparams = {\n    'jql': 'project = EXM AND resolution is not EMPTY',\n    'expand': 'changelog',\n}\n\nreq = requests.get(base_url + 'search/', headers=headers, params=params, auth=(username, password))\n\nprint(req.content)\n\n\nNotice that setting a variable equal to the request will equal the result of\nthat request. Printing r  alone would return a numerical status code (200, 404,\netc). The response that comes back from request such as r  are actually complex\nobjects — printing r.json()  will display the contents of the response as a JSON\nobject. Alternatively, r.text  returns the raw response as a string.\n\nIf your response comes back with an error, remember that you can always debug\nyour requests via Postman [https://www.getpostman.com/].\n\nIf all went well with our request, r.json()  should return something similar to\nthe following:\n\n{  \n   \"expand\":\"schema,names\",\n   \"startAt\":0,\n   \"maxResults\":50,\n   \"total\":63,\n   \"issues\":[  \n      {  \n         \"expand\":\"operations,versionedRepresentations,editmeta,changelog,renderedFields\",\n         \"id\":\"10558\",\n         \"self\":\"https://hackersandslackers.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/10558\",\n         \"key\":\"HSB-63\",\n         \"fields\":{  \n            \"issuetype\":{  \n               \"self\":\"https://hackersandslackers.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issuetype/10007\",\n               \"id\":\"10007\",\n               \"description\":\"Non-development related content task\",\n               \"iconUrl\":\"https://hackersandslackers.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10306&avatarType=issuetype\",\n               \"name\":\"Content\",\n               \"subtask\":false,\n               \"avatarId\":10306\n            },\n         }\n    ]\n}\n\n\nThe entirety of the request is probably much longer (depending on how many\nissues you have). Notice how JIRA will only return a maximum of 50 results\nunless otherwise specified (this is one of the parameters they accept). Feel\nfree to check out JIRA's API documentation to see what else you can do, but be\nwarned: their docs kind of suck.\n\nRetrieving information is cool, but modifying it is even better. Here's a use\ncase which might be immediately useful: creating a user.\n\nPOST Requests\nIn addition to the arguments GET requests can receive, POST requests can also\naccept arguments like as data.  This is where we tell the API the specifics of\nwhat we're trying to do.\n\nCommon POST Arguments\n * url: Endpoint URL.\n * params  (optional): Dictionary of variables to be passed as parameters of a\n   query string.\n * body  (optional): A JSON or  ML object sent in the body of the Request.\n * headers  (optional):  Dictionary of HTTP Headers to send with the Request.\n * auth  (optional):  Auth to enable Basic/Digest/Custom HTTP Auth.\n\nLet There be Users\nThe main difference between this request and the last will be what we pass via\nthe data  argument. For example's sake we'll be creating a user named bro  with\nthe appropriate broiest details.\n\nTake special note of json.dumps(userdata). If an endpoint is expecting JSON (it\nprobably is) we need to explicitly convert our dictionary of values to JSON\nbefore making this request.\n\nimport requests\nimport json\nfrom creds import username\nfrom creds import password\n\nbase_url = \"https://examplejira.com/rest/api/2/\"\nheaders = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}\nuserdata = {\n  'username': 'bro',\n  'name': 'Bro',\n  'password': '32456456',\n  'email': 'bro@broiest.com',\n  \"notification\" : \"true\"\n}\n\nreq = requests.post(base_url + 'user/', data=json.dumps(userdata), headers=headers, auth=(username, password))\n\nprint(req.content)\n\n\n\nYou just created a user. That's basically like giving birth to a child.\nCongratulations.\n\nAdvanced POST Requests\nAs fun as it is to create bro users in JIRA instances, one-off usage of APIs\nlike this isn't really useful. We haven't done anything that we couldn't have\njust done ourselves via the UI.\n\nTo spice things up, here's a very real use case: importing a list of users via a\nCSV. As we speak, people in corporations around the world are manually adding\nthousands of users by hand to internal SaaS products. Don't be that person.\n\nThis request will do the following:\n\n * Use pandas  to open users.csv   (presumably this CSV should have columns for\n   name, email, etc)\n * Generate a random password using secrets\n * Use the CSV to create accounts with each user's information\n * Output the result to users_created.csv\n * \n\n# JIRA User Import\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport requests\nimport secrets\nimport json\n\n# store credentials\nfrom creds import username\nfrom creds import password\n\n# dataframe from csv\nuser_df = pd.read_csv('users.csv')\n\n# store results of import\nrows_list = []\n\nheaders = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}\nbase_url = \"https://examplejira.com/rest/api/2/\"\n\n# generate 20-character password\ndef generate_password():\n    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\n    password = ''.join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for i in range(20))\n    return password\n\n# iterate and create users\nfor index, row in user_df.iterrows():\n    userdata = {\n        \"name\": row['email'].split('@')[0],\n        \"password\": generate_password(),\n        \"emailAddress\": row['email'],\n        \"displayName\": row['name'],\n        \"notification\" : \"true\"\n    }\n    req = requests.post(base_url + 'user/', data=json.dumps(userdata), headers=headers, auth=(jirauser, password))\n    rows_list.append(userdata) # adds row to array to be tracked\n    # create & export results to a csv\n    users_imported_df = pd.DataFrame(rows_list)\n    users_imported_df.to_csv('users_created.csv')\n\n\n\nIf this worked for you, take a moment to put something in perspective: you just\nautomated somebody's entire 9-5 job in a few minutes.\n\nAlso feel free to reflect on our purpose as a species. If automating this was so\nstraightforward, why do so many of us choose not to automate more tasks? Is our\nentire economy a hoax created to grant the masses an illusion of free will? Are\nwe running around in circles trying to solve problems we create ourselves, to\npay the bills which come with being employed? Finally: if robots are clearly\nthis superior, is there a purpose for the human race at all?\n\nNow you're asking the real questions. Hail Megatron.","html":"<p><a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/making-ajax-calls-with-jquery/\">Last episode</a> we covered every programming noob's favorite 'A-ha' moment: making GET requests using AJAX. Stepping stones such as these can serve as great turning points in a career, but they also expose how little we still know. For instance, when we integrated the functional logic of APIs on the client side, we actually broke a cardinal rule: storing and passing private keys on the client side like an idiot. Does that make everything we learned useless? Not entirely, but kinda yeah.</p><p>Today we'll do the equivalent in Python by using the <em>requests</em> library. Requests is successor to Urllib, both of which are simple tools to retrieve or modify information on the web, most commonly in the case of APIs.</p><p>We'll be using JIRA's API as an example of how to format GET and POST requests. JIRA's API in particular is an excellent example of a powerful and useful API. There's a ton we can do, thus a perfect demonstration of how much power one library can give you.</p><h2 id=\"batteries-not-included\">Batteries Not Included</h2><p>Even I sometimes forget that requests is not a built-in Python library. Make sure <strong>requests</strong> is installed in your environment via <code>pip install requests</code>.</p><p>Create a file in your directory called <code>creds.py</code> to store your credentials. Make sure to add that file to your <code>.gitignore</code> if you plan on committing anything any time soon.</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\"># creds.py\nusername = fake.user\npassword = securepassword123\n</code></pre>\n<p>The only libraries we need to import are <code>requests</code> and <code>json</code>. Make sure you import your credentials from the file you created earlier.</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">import requests\nimport json\nfrom creds import username, password\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"get-requests\">GET Requests</h2><p>As long as you have a URL, you can make a GET request. The requests library will return the content of any page it hits; if you make a request to an HTML page, your response will be that page's HTML source.</p><p>When we know what sort of data we're expecting to receive back, we can specify the expected <em>content type</em> by passing the <em>headers</em> argument, and specifying the <em>Content-Type</em>. Authentication is handled via passing arguments as well, specifically the <em>auth</em> argument. Take a look at what you can pass in a GET request:</p><h3 id=\"common-get-arguments\">Common GET Arguments</h3><ul><li><strong>url:</strong> The URL we will either retrieve or pass the information along to.</li><li><strong>parameters</strong> (optional):  Depending on the API, some URLs can accept a dictionary of variables to be passed along with the URL. These are called query strings; you notice these all the time whenever you come across a URL that looks like nonsense... that nonsense is information!</li><li><strong>headers</strong> (optional): A collection of metadata sent along with the request. Our browsers send HTTP headers every time we visit a site, but the scope of what a header value might cover ranges from tokens to content types.</li><li><strong>auth</strong> (optional):  Method for logging in if needed. Basic/Digest/Custom HTTP Auth.</li></ul><h3 id=\"let-s-get-some\">Let’s GET Some</h3><p>We're going to make a relatively simple request to pull open tickets from a JIRA project called <em>EXM.</em></p><p>This request will:</p><ul><li>Accept our destination's base URL</li><li>Append 'search/' (the endpoint for searching issues)</li><li>Pass two parameters:  A query to return issues A flag to show the issue history</li><li>Authenticate with our username/password</li><li>Print the result</li></ul><pre><code class=\"language-python\">import requests\nimport json\nfrom creds import username\nfrom creds import password\n\nbase_url = 'https://examplejira.com/rest/api/2/'\nheaders = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}\nparams = {\n    'jql': 'project = EXM AND resolution is not EMPTY',\n    'expand': 'changelog',\n}\n\nreq = requests.get(base_url + 'search/', headers=headers, params=params, auth=(username, password))\n\nprint(req.content)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that setting a variable equal to the request will equal the result of that request. Printing <code>r</code> alone would return a numerical status code (200, 404, etc). The response that comes back from request such as <code>r</code> are actually complex objects — printing <code>r.json()</code> will display the contents of the response as a JSON object. Alternatively, <code>r.text</code> returns the raw response as a string.</p><p>If your response comes back with an error, remember that you can always debug your requests via <a href=\"https://www.getpostman.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Postman</a>.</p><p>If all went well with our request, <code>r.json()</code> should return something similar to the following:</p><pre><code class=\"language-json\">{  \n   &quot;expand&quot;:&quot;schema,names&quot;,\n   &quot;startAt&quot;:0,\n   &quot;maxResults&quot;:50,\n   &quot;total&quot;:63,\n   &quot;issues&quot;:[  \n      {  \n         &quot;expand&quot;:&quot;operations,versionedRepresentations,editmeta,changelog,renderedFields&quot;,\n         &quot;id&quot;:&quot;10558&quot;,\n         &quot;self&quot;:&quot;https://hackersandslackers.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/10558&quot;,\n         &quot;key&quot;:&quot;HSB-63&quot;,\n         &quot;fields&quot;:{  \n            &quot;issuetype&quot;:{  \n               &quot;self&quot;:&quot;https://hackersandslackers.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issuetype/10007&quot;,\n               &quot;id&quot;:&quot;10007&quot;,\n               &quot;description&quot;:&quot;Non-development related content task&quot;,\n               &quot;iconUrl&quot;:&quot;https://hackersandslackers.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=xsmall&amp;avatarId=10306&amp;avatarType=issuetype&quot;,\n               &quot;name&quot;:&quot;Content&quot;,\n               &quot;subtask&quot;:false,\n               &quot;avatarId&quot;:10306\n            },\n         }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The entirety of the request is probably much longer (depending on how many issues you have).

All of it. We're\nin a unique place in human history where we've somehow managed to mine more data\nthan we know what to do with... and a lot of that data is easily accessible via\nAPIs.\n\nWe're going to get our feet wet with REST APIs today, thus allowing us to\ninteract with meaningful information. Making Ajax GET calls with JQuery  is\nperhaps as basic as it gets: there's a good chance we already know all this\nstuff, but even I constantly forget the exact syntax of everyday functions.\nChances are I'm going to come back to this post at some point just to copy and\npaste the snippets below. \n\nIntroduction to REST APIs\nIf you're new to executing AJAX requests, chances are you may be new to REST\nAPIs in general. This crash course is going to be fast and rough around the\nedges, so strap in.\n\nIn the most simple sense, a REST API endpoint is a URL. It just so happens that\nthis URL probably expects more from you than simply visiting it, and as a\nresult, should output something useful for you. API Endpoints will almost always\noutput either JSON or XML; these responses will give you information varying\nfrom error codes to the actual data you seek.\n\nREST APIs expect requests to come in one of the following forms:\n\n * GET: A request looking for read-only data. Some GET requests simply need to\n   be copy and pasted into a browser window to receive results, but usually we\n   need to either authenticate or specify what we're looking for.\n * POST: A write  request to the target resource. Expects that new information\n   will come as a result of this request.\n * PUT: Updates pre-existing data somewhere, likely in some database.\n * PATCH: Somewhat similar to PUT, and in my experience rarely used at all.\n * DELETE: Expects that information will be deleted as a result of the request\n\nIf this all seems like new information, I'd highly recommend downloading Postman\n[https://www.getpostman.com/]  to become familiar with how API calls are\nstructured.\n\nFor now, we'll focus on working with a simple GET endpoint.\n\nLearning By Doing\nIf you've been checking out Snkia's roundup posts\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/tag/roundup/]  lately, you may have noticed\nnifty link previews being generated. To demonstrate how to make API calls via a\nfrontend client with JQuery, we'll be walking through how to create link\npreviews using the LinkPreview API [https://www.linkpreview.net/]. This service\nserves as a good tutorial because:\n\n * It's an example of a simple GET endpoint\n * There's a quick and immediately useful end result\n * It's free\n\nTell me That Ain't Insecurr\nI want to stress here that we're doing this for the sake of learning; while this\nis probably the fastest  way to start working with an API, it is most definitely\n not secure.\n\nMaking calls with private keys stored and passed via the client side exposes\nyour key publicly. In a production environment, this is like shoving your\npassword in people's faces. People will most definitely want to steal and\nexploit your private key: if what you were doing didn't have any value, it\nwouldn't require a key in the first place.\n\nHopefully this has scared you enough to consider passing credentials in the\nfuture. That said, there's another solid reason we selected LinkPreview as\ntoday's example. LinkPreview offers domain whitelisting for requests, so even if\nsomebody did steal your key, they'd only be able to use it from your domain ;).\n\nMake sure you whitelist the domain you'll be working from.Fetch Me Daddy\nGo get started with an API key over at LinkPreview  if you're following along.\nI'm going to assume you already have JQuery  readily available from here\nforward.\n\nTo get started, we'll wait for our document to load, and set two critical\nvariables: the API URL, and our API key.\n\n$( document ).ready(function() {\n  var api_url = 'https://api.linkpreview.net'\n  var key = '5b578yg9yvi8sogirbvegoiufg9v9g579gviuiub8' // not real\n});\n\n\nIf you're following along what we've done with Lynx Roundups, our next step is\nto get all the relevant  <a>  tags on a page, loop through them, and replace\nthem with their respective link previews.\n\n$( document ).ready(function() {\n  var api_url = 'https://api.linkpreview.net'\n  var key = '5b578yg9yvi8sogirbvegoiufg9v9g579gviuiub8' // not real\n  \n  $( \".content a\" ).each(function( index, element ) {\n      console.log($( this ).text());\n  }\n});\n\n\nThe JQuery  .each  method creates a loop which iterates over every element\nmatching the provided selector. In our example, we only want <a>  tags in the\ncontent of our page; otherwise we would get all  links, like navigation links\nand so forth.\n\nNow it's time to bring in that $.ajax()  thing we've been going off about.\n\n$( document ).ready(function() {\n  var api_url = 'https://api.linkpreview.net'\n  var key = '5b578yg9yvi8sogirbvegoiufg9v9g579gviuiub8' // not real\n\n  $( \".content a\" ).each(function( index, element ) {\n\n    $.ajax({\n        url: api_url + \"?key=\" + key + \" &q=\" + $( this ).text(),\n        contentType: \"application/json\",\n        dataType: 'json',\n        success: function(result){\n            console.log(result);\n        }\n    })\n  });\n});\n\n\nThis is how Ajax request are structured: the contents of $.ajax()  is\nessentially an object taking values it will use to construct the request. The\nabove example is about as simple as it gets for making a barebones GET call.\nWe're looping through each <a>  tag and passing its contents (the url) to the\nAPI, and receiving an object in response.\n\nAjax requests can take way more parameters than the ones we just specified. I\nrecommend reading over the JQuery Ajax documentation\n[http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/]  closely; not only for the sake of these\nrequests, but understanding the potential items we can specify will solidify an\nunderstanding for REST APIs in general.\n\nThe line contentType: \"application/json\"  specifies that the content coming back\nto us will be in JSON format - this is a very common header when dealing with\nREST APIs. \n\nWith any luck, your response should come back looking like:\n\n{\n    \"title\":\"Google\",\n    \"description\":\"Search webpages, images, videos and more.\",\n    \"image\":\"https//:www.google.com/images/logo.png\",\n    \"url\":\"https://www.google.com/\"\n}\n\n\nIf you'd like to use this in a meaningful way, feel free to do something like\nthe mess I've put together below:\n\n$( document ).ready(function() {\n  var api_url = 'https://api.linkpreview.net'\n  var key = '5b578yg9yvi8sogirbvegoiufg9v9g579gviuiub8' // not real\n\n  $( \".content a\" ).each(function( index, element ) {\n    $.ajax({\n        url: api_url + \"?key=\" + key + \" &q=\" + $( this ).text(),\n        contentType: \"application/json\",\n        dataType: 'json',\n        success: function(result){\n            $( element ).after(\n            '<a href=\"' + result.url + '\"> \\n ' +\n              '<div class=\"link-preview\"> \\n ' +\n                '<div class=\"preview-image\" style=\"background-image:url(' + result.image + ');\"></div> \\n ' + \n                '<div style=\"width:70%;\" class=\"link-info\"> \\n ' +\n                  '<h4>' + result.title +'</h4> \\n ' +\n                  '<p>' + result.description +'</p> \\n ' +\n                '</div><br> \\n ' +\n                  '<a href=\"' + result.url + '\" class=\"url-info\"><i class=\"far fa-link\"></i>' + result.url + '</a> \\n ' +\n                '</div></a>');\n            $( element ).remove();\n        }\n    })\n  });\n});\n\n\nThat template should serve you well for most GET API calls you're going to make\nvia JQuery.

All of it. We're in a unique place in human history where we've somehow managed to mine more data than we know what to do with... and a lot of that data is easily accessible via APIs.</p><p>We're going to get our feet wet with REST APIs today, thus allowing us to interact with meaningful information. Making Ajax GET calls with <strong>JQuery</strong> is perhaps as basic as it gets: there's a good chance we already know all this stuff, but even I constantly forget the exact syntax of everyday functions. Chances are I'm going to come back to this post at some point just to copy and paste the snippets below. </p><h2 id=\"introduction-to-rest-apis\">Introduction to REST APIs</h2><p>If you're new to executing AJAX requests, chances are you may be new to REST APIs in general. This crash course is going to be fast and rough around the edges, so strap in.</p><p>In the most simple sense, a REST API endpoint is a URL. It just so happens that this URL probably expects more from you than simply visiting it, and as a result, should output something useful for you. API Endpoints will almost always output either JSON or XML; these responses will give you information varying from error codes to the actual data you seek.</p><p>REST APIs expect requests to come in one of the following forms:</p><ul><li><strong>GET</strong>: A request looking for read-only data. Some GET requests simply need to be copy and pasted into a browser window to receive results, but usually we need to either authenticate or specify what we're looking for.</li><li><strong>POST</strong>: A <em>write</em> request to the target resource. Expects that new information will come as a result of this request.</li><li><strong>PUT</strong>: Updates pre-existing data somewhere, likely in some database.</li><li><strong>PATCH</strong>: Somewhat similar to PUT, and in my experience rarely used at all.</li><li><strong>DELETE: </strong>Expects that information will be deleted as a result of the request</li></ul><p>If this all seems like new information, I'd highly recommend downloading <a href=\"https://www.getpostman.com/\">Postman</a> to become familiar with how API calls are structured.</p><p>For now, we'll focus on working with a simple GET endpoint.</p><h2 id=\"learning-by-doing\">Learning By Doing</h2><p>If you've been checking out <a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/tag/roundup/\">Snkia's roundup posts</a> lately, you may have noticed nifty link previews being generated. To demonstrate how to make API calls via a frontend client with <strong>JQuery</strong>, we'll be walking through how to create link previews using the <a href=\"https://www.linkpreview.net/\">LinkPreview API</a>. This service serves as a good tutorial because:</p><ul><li>It's an example of a simple GET endpoint</li><li>There's a quick and immediately useful end result</li><li>It's free</li></ul><h3 id=\"tell-me-that-ain-t-insecurr\">Tell me That Ain't Insecurr</h3><p>I want to stress here that we're doing this for the sake of learning; while this is probably the <em>fastest</em> way to start working with an API, it is most definitely <strong>not secure</strong>.</p><p>Making calls with private keys stored and passed via the client side exposes your key publicly. In a production environment, this is like shoving your password in people's faces. People will most definitely want to steal and exploit your private key: if what you were doing didn't have any value, it wouldn't require a key in the first place.</p><p>Hopefully this has scared you enough to consider passing credentials in the future. That said, there's another solid reason we selected LinkPreview as today's example.
