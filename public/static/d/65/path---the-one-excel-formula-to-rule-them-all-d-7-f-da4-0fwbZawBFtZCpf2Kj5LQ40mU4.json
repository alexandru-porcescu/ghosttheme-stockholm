With this knowledge, you've actually been armed\nwith the keys to the kingdom, and you're finally going to learn how to do\nsomething fancy.\n\nThere comes a time in every person's life where just by learning one piece of\ninformation, suddenly everything else you've learned clicks into place. For\nthose who utilize Excel, learning this formula WILL  BE THAT FOR YOU. In our\nlast entry, I stated very plainly that there are only a handful of formulae that\nare used on a regular basis, and this is easily the most useful and  the most\nflexible, to the point in which knowing how to use this formula (along with a\ntool that we'll discuss next time) are the SOLE job skills required to get an\nentry level job in finance note...put this somewhere on your resume.\n\nWhat is this mythical savior of white collar workers worldwide? In the past, you\nmay have heard muffled whispers of \"v-lookup\" or if your data was particularly\npoorly formatted perhaps even \"h-lookup\", however, after 2007, the minds behind\nthe spreadsheets threw both of those formulae into a blender, mixed it with\nRedbull and amphetamines, and spit out the king of functions: the =Index(Match))\n.\n\nSo, after all that incredibly well deserved hype, what is index-match, and why\nis it so special? To put things incredibly simply, index-match checks (or as the\ncool kids say: \"bump-up against\" one piece of information (say, a list of ID\nnumbers) against another piece of information (say a second list of IDs) and\nspits out the data associated with the matching values (Say, the name associated\nwith that ID number). The reasons for the importance of these commands can not\nbe overstated, as anyone who works with data in any capacity knows that\nidentifying changes (and where the changes are) over different iterations of a\nparticular dataset is an essential  job function.\n\nNow, hopefully you're starting to see the light, and understanding the power\nthat this formula holds, so now we're going to learn how to use it.\nFirst things first, if you're a particularly perceptive reader, you may have\nguessed from how I wrote the formula that =Index(Match)) is actually the\ncombination of two separate formulae that alone are of limited use, but\ntogether, they allow you to accomplish great things. These two formulae are:\n\n 1. INDEX  which asks to look at an array (essentially a list of cells), and\n    pull out the data at a specific row and column number within that array (\n    interesting fact: despite using letters for columns and numbers for rows,\n    Excel actually translates the column letters into a number with 1=A and so\n    on). Index by itself isn't super useful, as, much like when you're viewing a\n    particle, or cooking Meth, you rarely know both dimensions of a cell that\n    you're looking for (that was a Heisenberg uncertainty principle joke...or a\n    Breaking Bad reference, depending on how you roll.)\n 2. MATCH  is the formula that does most of the heavy lifting. Match checks to\n    see where a value exists within an array that you specify, and returns the\n    position in the array (for example, if you match \"C\" on a list of letters of\n    the Roman alphabet, match will tell you \"3\").\n\nNow here's where the magic happens. Remember when I said that everything in\nExcel is basically just a collection of numbers? Well, in that respect when a\nformula asks you for a number, there's no reason why you can't throw in ANOTHER \nformula that spits out a number. As such, if you tell Index where you want to\ngrab something from, and then instead of giving it a position, you give it the\nnumber that pops up from Match (which is a formula which gives you the location\nof where something matches) you've given Index all the information it needs to\ndo it's work, all without needing to know where (or if at all) the value exists.\n\nThe formula in practice is written like this:\n\n**=INDEX(*column or row where you want to grab the information from*,MATCH(*the cell containing the value that you want to look for*,*column or row where you want to check for the value*,0)) (don't forget the zero at the end, that just means you want to match the value exactly)\n\nAs such, if you have the following data\n\nSheet 1\nCOLUMN ACOLUMN B\n 1bob\n 2sam\n 3steve\n 4larry\n Sheet 2\nCOLUMN ACOLUMN B\n 2\n 3\n 12\n 18\n If you want to return the name associated with any of the numbers in sheet 2,\nyou can plug the column containing the names in the Index, the cell containing\nthe value that you want to find the associated name with as the first part of\nthe match, and the column containing the IDs associated with the names as the\nsecond part of the match, the formula will spit out the name (or an error\nstating that the value doesn't match a name). The best part is, this formula can\nget dragged down the entire list of numbers to return the names associated with \nall  of the IDs. Now, this is with a very small set of data, but it works just\nas well, and just as quickly if you're looking at 10,000 IDs.\n\nWith that being said, I hope you've learned the answer to a question you didn't\neven know you had, and I hope index-match starts saving you time (or snagging\nyou a promotion!) immediately.\n\nIn summary we've learned the following:\n\n 1. The function of INDEX\n 2. The function of MATCH (protip: if all you want to do is see if something\n    matches and don't need to see what it's associated with, you can use match\n    by itself, is =ISNUMBER(Match)) which will give you a nice true false\n 3. How you can utilize a formula as a variable in another formula (you don't\n    need to put in a second equals sign if you're doing this, but you do need\n    another set of parenthesis)\n 4. How to write an Index(Match)) formula\n 5. The main use for Index-Match (by thinking outside the box, there are an\n    infinite number of uses)\n 6. The realization that by knowing this formula, you never need to compare\n    things by hand again and eye again!\n\nNext time, we'll discuss the other frequently used Excel tool, that together\nwith the powers of Index-Match, literally make up the entry level analyst's\ntoolkit. Also, as a bonus entry in the interim, you'll get a quick rundown of\nhow you can leverage your knowledge of Index-match in a conversation with\nsomeone who knows what they're talking about.\n\nIn Hoc Signo,\n\n-Snacks","html":"<p>In my last entry, we discussed how to write a formula, and you've been armed with what each piece of the formula represents (the command, the variables, and the definition of an array).
