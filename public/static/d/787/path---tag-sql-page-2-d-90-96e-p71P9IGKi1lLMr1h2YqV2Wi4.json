A Python MySQL library: PyMySQL\n[https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL].\n\nPyMySQL is lightweight and perfect for fulfilling MySQL queries. If you want\nbells and whistles, you're probably barking up the wrong tree (and you probably\nshould‚Äôve used a DB other than MySQL in the first place).\n\nWhy write tutorials for technologies we openly trash talk? Out of necessity, of\ncourse! There's nothing wrong with MySQL, most enterprises are married to it in\nsome way. Thus, A great use case for PyMySQL is for usage in AWS lambda when\nworking with large enterprise systems. We'll get to that, but for now let's cook\nup something good.\n\nHeat up the Stove\nTurn on the gas and prep the table to set with your favorite collection of\nplates! That's right, we're talking boilerplate. We knew this was coming; it\nseems like every time you want to do something tangibly cool, we need to get\ninto the business of managing connections and whatnot.\n\nTo ease the pain, I'll share with you a preferred method of handling opening\nconnections with PyMySQL. Here we set a function to separate basic connection\nlogic and error messaging from our app:\n\nimport sys\nimport pymysql\nimport logger\n\nconn = None\n\ndef openConnection():\n    global conn\n    try:\n        if(conn is None):\n            conn = pymysql.connect(rds_host, user=name, passwd=password, db=db_name, connect_timeout=5)\n        elif (not conn.open):\n            conn = pymysql.connect(rds_host, user=name, passwd=password, db=db_name, connect_timeout=5)    \n    except:\n        logger.error(\"ERROR: Unexpected error: Could not connect to MySql instance.\")\n        sys.exit()\n\n\n\nNothing fancy here: we set a global variable conn  to serve as our connection,\nand have some basic logic on how to interact with our database. Running \nopenConnection  will attempt to connect to a MySQL db with supplied credentials,\nor throw an error if something goes horribly wrong.\n\nNow we can keep this separate from the rest of our code. Out of sight, out of\nmind.\n\nMeat and Potatoes\nWith the boring stuff out of the way, let's dig into some goodness. We'll start\noff with a basic use case: selecting all rows from a table:\n\ndef getRecords():\n    try:\n        openConnection()\n        with conn.cursor() as cur:\n            sql = \"SELECT * FROM table\"\n            cur.execute(sql)\n            result = cur.fetchall()\n            print(result)\n            cur.close()\n            conn.close()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n    finally:\n        print('Query Successful')\n        \ngetRecords() \n\n\nWe split our function into your standard try/except/finally  breakdown. What\nwe're trying is opening a connection using the function we created earlier, and\nrunning queries against it.\n\nThe preferred syntax in PyMySQL is to keep our query in a single string, as seen\nin our variable sql. With our query ready, we need to execute  the query, fetch \nthe resulting records and print the result. We're sure to close the connection\nonce we're done with executing queries... this is critical to ensure db\nconnections don't stay active.\n\nSimple so far, but we're about to kick it up a notch.\n\nSelecting rows\nYou may have noticed we used .fetchall()  to select all records. This is\nimportant to differentiate from .fetchone(), which simply selects the first\nrecord.\n\nWe can iterate over the rows resulting from .fetchall()  with a simple loop, as\nshown in the example below. Beware: attempting to print the result of \n.fetchall()  will simply result in a single integer, which represents the number\nof rows fetched. If there are instances where we know only one record should be\nreturned, .fetchone()  should be used instead.\n\ndef getRecords(table):\n    try:\n        openConnection()\n        with conn.cursor() as cur:\n            sql = \"SELECT * FROM %s\"\n            cur.execute(sql, table)\n            result = cur.fetchall()\n            for row in result:\n                record = {\n                        'id': row[0],\n                        'name': row[1],\n                        'email': row[2],\n                        'phone': row[3],\n\n                    }\n            cur.close()\n            conn.close()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n    finally:\n        print('Query Successful')\n        \ngetRecords('table_name')       \n\n\nWhoa, what's with the %s? This is how we pass arguments into queries in PyMySQL.\nThe PyMySQL guys were kind enough to realize how obnoxious it is to constantly\nbreak strings to pass in variables - in the case of SQL queries, this beyond\nobnoxious and borderline unworkable. Remember that MySQL requires explicit\nquotations around passing string values, so queries such as these become a\nnonsensical jumble of escaped characters.\n\nPyMySQL supports backquotes: the distant cousin of the single quotation mark,\nAKA the diagonal quote thing above the tilde ~ button on your keyboard. You\nknow: `. If there comes a time to set a string within your query use this\nelusive quotation as such: sql = \"SELECT * FROM %s WHERE column_name =\n`somevalue`\"Updating Rows of Data\nArguments can be passed as anything inside a query: they simply appear in the\norder in which they are passed. In the below example, we pass table as an\nargument, as well values we want updated, and the identifier for target rows:\n\ndef getRecords(table, data):\n    try:\n        openConnection()\n        with conn.cursor() as cur:\n            sql = \"UPDATE %s SET date=%s, numsent=%s WHERE email = %s\"\n            cur.execute(sql, (table, data['date_sent'], data['status'], data['email']))\n            conn.commit()\n            cur.close()\n            conn.close()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n    finally:\n        print('Query Successful')\n\ndata = {\n    'date_sent': '12/01/2018'\n    'email': 'fakeemail@example.com'\n    'status': 'Confirmed'\n}\ngetRecords('table_name', data)       \n\n\nHeads up:  Note the line conn.commit(). Don't forget that - this is what\nactually commits the update to the database. Forgetting this line and wasting\nhours debugging is somewhat of a rite of passage, but let's just skip all that.\n\nFor Dessert: Usage in AWS Lambda\nIt is my treat to share with you my world famous copy & paste recipe for AWS\nLambda. Here we store all of our db credentials in a separate file called \nrdsconfig.py. We also enable logging to take us through what is happening each\nstep of the way:\n\nimport sys\nimport logging\nimport rds_config\nimport pymysql\n\n#rds settings\nrds_host  = \"rdsName.dfsd834mire.us-west-3.rds.amazonaws.com\"\nname = rds_config.db_username\npassword = rds_config.db_password\ndb_name = rds_config.db_name\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger()\nlogger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n\nconn = None\n\ndef openConnection():\n    global conn\n    try:\n        if(conn is None):\n            conn = pymysql.connect(rds_host, user=name, passwd=password, db=db_name, connect_timeout=10)\n        elif (not conn.open):\n            conn = pymysql.connect(rds_host, user=name, passwd=password, db=db_name, connect_timeout=10)\n    except:\n        logger.error(\"ERROR: Could not connect to MySql instance.\")\n        sys.exit()\n\n\nlogger.info(\"SUCCESS: Connection to RDS mysql instance succeeded\")\n\n\nWe thank you all for joining us in this adventure of tantalizing treats. May\nyour data be clean and your stomachs full.\n\nBon app√©tit.","html":"<p>It's almost Friday night, and the squad at H+S is ready to get cooking.

We'll start off with a basic use case: selecting all rows from a table:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-python\">def getRecords():\n    try:\n        openConnection()\n        with conn.cursor() as cur:\n            sql = &quot;SELECT * FROM table&quot;\n            cur.execute(sql)\n            result = cur.fetchall()\n            print(result)\n            cur.close()\n            conn.close()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n    finally:\n        print('Query Successful')\n        \ngetRecords() \n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>We split our function into your standard <em>try/except/finally</em> breakdown. What we're trying is opening a connection using the function we created earlier, and running queries against it.</p><p>The preferred syntax in PyMySQL is to keep our query in a single string, as seen in our variable <em>sql</em>. With our query ready, we need to <em>execute</em> the query, <em>fetch</em> the resulting records and print the result. We're sure to close the connection once we're done with executing queries... this is critical to ensure db connections don't stay active.</p><p>Simple so far, but we're about to kick it up a notch.</p><h3 id=\"selecting-rows\">Selecting rows</h3><p>You may have noticed we used <em>.fetchall()</em> to select all records. This is important to differentiate from <em>.fetchone()</em>, which simply selects the first record.</p><p>We can iterate over the rows resulting from <em>.fetchall()</em> with a simple loop, as shown in the example below. Beware: attempting to print the result of <em>.fetchall()</em> will simply result in a single integer, which represents the number of rows fetched. If there are instances where we know only one record should be returned, <em>.fetchone()</em> should be used instead.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-python\">def getRecords(table):\n    try:\n        openConnection()\n        with conn.cursor() as cur:\n            sql = &quot;SELECT * FROM %s&quot;\n            cur.execute(sql, table)\n            result = cur.fetchall()\n            for row in result:\n                record = {\n                        'id': row[0],\n                        'name': row[1],\n                        'email': row[2],\n                        'phone': row[3],\n\n                    }\n            cur.close()\n            conn.close()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n    finally:\n        print('Query Successful')\n        \ngetRecords('table_name')       \n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Whoa, what's with the <em><strong>%s</strong></em>? This is how we pass arguments into queries in PyMySQL. The PyMySQL guys were kind enough to realize how obnoxious it is to constantly break strings to pass in variables - in the case of SQL queries, this beyond obnoxious and borderline unworkable. Remember that MySQL requires explicit quotations around passing string values, so queries such as these become a nonsensical jumble of escaped characters.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"protip\">\nPyMySQL supports backquotes: the distant cousin of the single quotation mark, AKA the diagonal quote thing above the tilde ~ button on your keyboard. You know: `. If there comes a time to set a string within your query use this elusive quotation as such: <code>sql = \"SELECT * FROM %s WHERE column_name = `somevalue`\"</code>\n</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id=\"updating-rows-of-data\">Updating Rows of Data</h3><p>Arguments can be passed as anything inside a query: they simply appear in the order in which they are passed. In the below example, we pass table as an argument, as well values we want updated, and the identifier for target rows:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-python\">def getRecords(table, data):\n    try:\n        openConnection()\n        with conn.cursor() as cur:\n            sql = &quot;UPDATE %s SET date=%s, numsent=%s WHERE email = %s&quot;\n            cur.execute(sql, (table, data['date_sent'], data['status'], data['email']))\n            conn.commit()\n            cur.close()\n            conn.close()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n    finally:\n        print('Query Successful')\n\ndata = {\n    'date_sent': '12/01/2018'\n    'email': 'fakeemail@example.com'\n    'status': 'Confirmed'\n}\ngetRecords('table_name', data)       \n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>Heads up:</strong> Note the line <em>conn.commit()</em>. Don't forget that - this is what actually commits the update to the database. Forgetting this line and wasting hours debugging is somewhat of a rite of passage, but let's just skip all that.</p><h2 id=\"for-dessert-usage-in-aws-lambda\">For Dessert: Usage in AWS Lambda</h2><p>It is my treat to share with you my world famous copy &amp; paste recipe for AWS Lambda.

This\nleads us to the next most logical thing to ask: how can I use this in any\nmeaningful way?\n\nMySQL installations default to refusing connections outside of the local\nmachine's IP address, as we should expect. That said, relational databases\naren't usually being used by a single person on a single machine forever (but if\nyou do, we should hang out). It goes without saying that our MySQL instance\nshould be focusing on uptime and accessibility, or in other terms, far away from\nour destructive personalities.\n\nI adore maintaining databases in the command line as much as the next\nself-hating masochist, but we'll need to accomplish work at some point. That\nmeans the remote database we just set up needs to be open-minded enough to allow\na connection from, say, the IP address of our personal local machine, which\nhappens to have a sexy GUI installed for this very purpose.\n\nMaking these kinds of configuration changes to any service or web server is\nalways a bit of fun.

This leads us to the next most logical thing to ask: how can I use this in any meaningful way?</p><p>MySQL installations default to refusing connections outside of the local machine's IP address, as we should expect.

Without knowing much SQL at all, we can already see our databases, their\ntables, and get the values of whichever columns they might have. Now let's start\ndoing stuff.\n\nCreate a Database\nGo ahead and create a new database. In my case, I want to create a database\nwhich lists my Github repositories, so I'll create a db named github_repos:\n\nCREATE DATABASE github_repos;\nQuery OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> USE github_repos;\nDatabase changed\n\n\nCreating a table\nNow it's getting good: we're going to create a table in our database: to do\nthis, we're going to need to define our columns upfront, including the type of\ndata each column can accept as well as the restrictions on that column. I'm\nkeeping it simple and storing values of text for now.\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLE githubrepos (id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, \n    -> full_name VARCHAR(100),\n    -> description VARCHAR(300),\n    -> name VARCHAR(200),\n    -> url VARCHAR(150));\n\n\nid  is a standard column which indicates the numerical index of each row. Here,\nwe're stating that our rows will count themselves.\n\nEach following line creates a column by [name]  [type of data]****[limit]. In\nthis example we're creating columns which accept alphanumeric characters, up to\na maximum of the the number specified.\n\nNOTE: you should really overestimate the number of characters each field can\naccept. I didn't. Its a waste of time and might drive you crazy down the line:\njust accept a large number and be done with it.\n\nFruits of your labor\nGo ahead and check out what you've done:\n\nmysql> SHOW tables;\n\n+------------------------+\n| Tables_in_github_repos |\n+------------------------+\n| githubrepos            |\n+------------------------+\n\n\nDamn dude, you did it. Let's take a look just to make sure:\n\n+-------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+\n| Field       | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |\n+-------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+\n| id          | int(11)      | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |\n| full_name   | varchar(200) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |\n| description | varchar(300) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |\n| name        | varchar(200) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |\n| url         | varchar(200) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |\n+-------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+\n5 rows in set (0.01 sec)\n\n\nHoly shit it's literally a table.\n\nMaking Changes\nLet's make some changes to our table after the fact. We can use ALTER TABLE to\nadd, modify, or remove columns.\n\nmysql> ALTER TABLE githubrepos ADD homepage VARCHAR(255);\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.09 sec)\nRecords: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0\n\n\nThis added column homepage  which accepts alphanumeric characters.\n\nNow that we've created our own database with our own defined structure, the\npossibilities are endless. The next step is to actually fill it with data, but\nlet's save that for next time.\n\nmysql> \\q\nBye","html":"<p>As frameworks and services evolve to remove us further away from boilerplate code, the first casualty of saved time is the fundamental understanding of what we're actually doing sometimes.

In my case, I want to create a database which lists my Github repositories, so I'll create a db named <em>github_repos</em>:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-shell\">CREATE DATABASE github_repos;\nQuery OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql&gt; USE github_repos;\nDatabase changed\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id=\"creating-a-table\">Creating a table</h3><p>Now it's getting good: we're going to create a table in our database: to do this, we're going to need to define our columns upfront, including the type of data each column can accept as well as the restrictions on that column. I'm keeping it simple and storing values of text for now.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-shell\">mysql&gt; CREATE TABLE githubrepos (id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, \n    -&gt; full_name VARCHAR(100),\n    -&gt; description VARCHAR(300),\n    -&gt; name VARCHAR(200),\n    -&gt; url VARCHAR(150));\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>id</strong> is a standard column which indicates the numerical index of each row. Here, we're stating that our rows will count themselves.</p><p>Each following line creates a column by <strong>[name]</strong> <strong>[type of data]****[limit]</strong>. In this example we're creating columns which accept alphanumeric characters, up to a maximum of the the number specified.</p><p><em><strong>NOTE: you should really overestimate the number of characters each field can accept. I didn't. Its a waste of time and might drive you crazy down the line: just accept a large number and be done with it.</strong></em></p><h3 id=\"fruits-of-your-labor\">Fruits of your labor</h3><p>Go ahead and check out what you've done:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-shell\">mysql&gt; SHOW tables;\n\n+------------------------+\n| Tables_in_github_repos |\n+------------------------+\n| githubrepos            |\n+------------------------+\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Damn dude, you did it.

We can use ALTER TABLE to add, modify, or remove columns.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-shell\">mysql&gt; ALTER TABLE githubrepos ADD homepage VARCHAR(255);\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.09 sec)\nRecords: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>This added column <em>homepage</em> which accepts alphanumeric characters.</p><p>Now that we've created our own database with our own defined structure, the possibilities are endless. The next step is to actually fill it with data, but let's save that for next time.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-shell\">mysql&gt; \\q\nBye\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","url":"https://hackersandslackers.com/set-up-mysql-database/","uuid":"697bc755-a833-43fe-b807-5668b8c284f4","page":false,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"comment_id":"5ad56fd09bfe350c74e8a8cb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"sql","limit":12,"skip":12,"numberOfPages":2,"humanPageNumber":2,"prevPageNumber":1,"nextPageNumber":null,"previousPagePath":"/tag/sql/","nextPagePath":null}}
