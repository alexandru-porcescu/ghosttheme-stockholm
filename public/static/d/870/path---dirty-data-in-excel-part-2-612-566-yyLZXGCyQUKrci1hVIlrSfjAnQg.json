I\nhighly recommend you go back and read the first post on \"dirty\" data, but just\nin case you're one of those rebels who thinks that they're too cool to read part\n1, here's a quick refresher to put you back in the analytical mindset (which is\nthe perfect combination tactical laziness, ADHD, and a complete disregard for\ndownside risk).\n\nEssentially, the reason why most data analysts exist within a company (remember,\nNOT a tech company, hence the usage of Excel) is because for whatever reason,\nmost companies do not give analysts access to the data on demand, and instead it\nis tightly controlled by a mysterious cabal of DBAs or developers which I have\nchristened the dataratti.\n\nWhile this setup is workable in theory, the dataratti often do not have a strong\nunderstanding of how the data is used in practice, and there are generally not\nopen lines of communication between the dataratti and the analysts. Thus it\nfalls upon the analyst to do three crucial jobs:\n\n 1. Obtain raw  data from the dataratti (remember, raw means that the data is\n    just a bunch of numbers, words, and headings...meaningless on their own).\n 2. manipulate  the data so that it's in a readable format and does not have\n    unnecessary data.\n 3. Present this data in narrative form to the business people.\n\nNow, you may be asking why they can't just hire someone who knows both sides of\nthis equation, the answer is sadly simple: manipulating data in a tool like\nExcel is antithetical to the general idea of how databases are created (we'll\ntalk about that some more next time) and thus someone who has both skill-sets,\nas well as the ability to present to stakeholders (remember, Those Who Sit Above\nin Shadow?) is extremely rare, and trying to become  that person may not be the\nbest idea because it may actually be cheaper to hire two employees than hire\nsomeone with chops in both skills (and you can't just know  how to\nmanipulate/present and code, you have to know both very well).\n\nWith all that being said, last time we discussed how one might grab data from\nthe dataratti from a tool like Tableau (which is essentially a data\nvisualization toolkit that's really good at creating dashboards, but can only\nhandle limited variables...a.k.a. columns, and exports the actual data in a\nparticularly messy way). Now we'll talk about one of the other possibilities for\nthe enterprising analyst to grab raw data: Business Intelligence (BI) tools.\n\nDespite how cool it sounds and despite it immediately conjuring thoughts of\nengaging in corporate espionage as part of the Business Intelligence Agency, BI\nis at it's core really just an interface where someone who didn't design a\ndatabase can still query (that literally means \"ask\") the database for the data\nthat they want.\n\nThe way this works is pretty straightforward: there will be an interface with a\nseries of folders (just like you'd see on a desktop) and within each, there will\nbe a list of variables that you can drag-and-drop into your query. After putting\nin all of the variables that you want in your report, you just hit \"go\" and\nit'll show you all of the data associated with the variables...essentially\nletting you grab data from the database without touching it, and without knowing\nSQL. To sweeten the already sweet deal, you can even generally manipulate the\ndata after the query is done but before downloading (using a very similar format\nto Excel, although, why fix what ain't broken?), and you can set it up to re-run\nwhatever query you decided upon on a regular schedule.\n\nWell then, doesn't that just sound ideal, why didn't I lead with this clearly\nsuperior strategy? Obviously, there's a catch: not only are BI toolkits VERY\nexpensive, the implementation of a BI tool requires an entire OTHER level of\nemployee between the coders and the analysts. Remember way back when, in a\nprevious post, I stated that databases only build on top of themselves and grow\nincreasingly unwieldy the longer your company is in existence? Also, remember\nwhen I stated that the developers rarely know why their users need the data\nwithin the database? Well, that leads to the developers coding their databases\nin a way that only they  truly understand (if we were talking about anything\nother than a database, I'd even say that their code is...inelegant). Now imagine\nhaving having to take this mess of code on top of code that's starting to look\nlike Tetsuo at the end of Akira, and translating all of it to plain English that\nsomeone with no knowledge of database structures would be able to understand,\nand you're starting to get an idea of the struggle that a BI developer has ahead\nof them. To make matters worse, each BI tool requires this to be done in a\nspecific way, so the skills are only moderately transferable. Of note, in a\ncompany that relies on their data quite a bit, and when their database is\nconsiderably large, this quickly becomes a full-time job, if not the job of a\nsmall team.\n\nNow, despite the considerable front-end investment in a good BI team, the\nflexibility of being able to grab data on-demand ends up being significantly\nbetter in the long-term, especially when an analyst knows how to use tableau\nthemselves, and can make super slick graphic representations of the data...and\neveryone knows that the way to a business person's heart is with sick graphics.\n\nIn summary, today we explored the following:\n\n * A refresher of the counter-intuitive model of data siloing within companies.\n * An explanation of the role of an analyst within this company hierarchy.\n * How BI tools work and what some of the benefits and challenges of\n   implementation may be.\n\nNow that you know why the data you get comes out dirty, next time, we'll explore\nsome examples of how your data may arrive, and how to sculpt your data so that\nyou can make it work for you.\n\nPaz,\n\n-Snacks","html":"<p>In my last post, we explored the organizational structure of many large companies and how this pertains to one's duties as a fledgling data analyst.
