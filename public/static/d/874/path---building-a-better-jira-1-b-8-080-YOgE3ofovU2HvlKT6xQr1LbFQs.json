This naturally begs the question: Why is JIRA Service Desk's pricing\nmodel roughly 1/10th of that of it's competitor?\n\nThe answer lies within ease of use,  but more importantly, presentation. While\nAtlassian's cloud offering is slowly playing catchup, Atlassian as a company has\nnever quite seemed to nail down the importance of a friendly user interface, nor\nthe importance of this when it comes to worldwide adoption. To see what I mean,\nhere's an example that Atlassian themselves tout on their own documentation as a\n\"ready for production\" customer portal:\n\nI'm convinced this is purposefully hideous to force the purchase of plugins.To\nyour average software developer (Atlassian's core demographic for years), one\nmight see nothing wrong with this interface, but as somebody `who has rolled out\nover 30 of these desks for over 6 thousand people, layouts such as these commit\nnumerous UI atrocities which simply are not acceptable for top enterprise\nsoftware.\n\nWhat do we do about this? We build an alternative, of course.\n\nMethod to This Madness\nOur focus is not on JIRA as a product,  but rather an API. Instead of attempting\nto work within JIRA’s boundaries via customization or add-ons, we can take\nmatters into our own hands by owning the application that users use to interact\nwith a JIRA instance. By using the JIRA API, we can not only extend features but\nactually ‘rebuild’ the application to gain full control over the UI or\nadditional logic. JIRA is a hideous yet entirely necessary Java application,\nwhich makes it a perfect candidate for recreation.\n\nWe're going to use Flask for this. Shocking, I know. Here's the obligatory file\nstructure of our project:\n\nmyproject\n├─ app.py\n├─ jira.py\n├─ /static\n│  └─ js\n│  └─ less\n│  └─ img\n└─ /templates\n   └─ layout.html\n   └─ index.html\n\n\nThis tutorial will be working against the JIRA Server  API for Service Desk -\nthat said, Cloud users should still find this applicable.\n\nPulling Your Service Desk Form\nBefore we get nuts building our application, we’ll need to be sure that a\nService Desk already exists in JIRA with our expected intake form. Remember: our\nend goal is to simply consume JIRA as an API, but that entails interacting with\nsomething that exists in the first place.\n\nWith your Service Desk created, there’s one annoyance we need to resolve before\ngetting into code: determining your Service Desk’s ID number. Like most things\nin JIRA, Service Desks are identified by an ID which is simply an arbitrary\ngrouping of integers in some way. What is the official way to find this ID, you\nmight ask? Why, by extracting it from the portal’s URL or by inspecting your XHR\nrequests, of course! Remember: JIRA hates you, that’s why we’re doing this in\nthe first place.\n\nWith your Service Desk ID handy, we can finally break into retrieving our desk\nvia the Service Desk API:\n\nimport requests\nfrom jira_config import jira_username, jira_password\n\nrequest_types_endpoint = \"https://yourjirainstance.com/rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/[SERVICEDESKID]/requesttype/\"\n\nheaders = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}\n\ndef fieldsPerRequest(id):\n    \"\"\"Get form fields per request type.\"\"\"\n    r = requests.get(request_types_endpoint + id + '/field', auth=(jira_username, jira_password), headers=headers)\n    form = r.json()\n    return form\n\n\ndef serviceDeskRequestTypes():\n    \"\"\"Get request types.\"\"\"\n    request_array = []\n    r = requests.get(request_types_endpoint, auth=(jira_username, jira_password), headers=headers)\n    for requesttype in r.json()['values']:\n        id = requesttype['id']\n        request_dict = {\n            'name': requesttype['name'],\n            'description': requesttype['description'],\n            'icon': requesttype['icon']['_links']['iconUrls']['32x32'],\n            'fields': fieldsPerRequest(id)\n        }\n        request_array.append(request_dict)\n    return request_array\n\n\nserviceDeskRequestTypes()\nBy using the request_types_endpoint  URL, our function serviceDeskRequestTypes() \n returns the request types  of a given JIRA service desk; or in other words, the\n types of requests users can submit.  This alone only gives us high-level\ninformation about the types of requests we allow but doesn't go into further\ndetail such as the actual resulting form. That's where our next function comes\nin.\n\nfieldsPerRequest()\nThis function gets passed the ID of each request type. With that, we extend our\nendpoint to look like \n'https://yourjirainstance.com/rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/[SERVICEDESKID]/requesttype/[REQUESTID]/field'\n. Looping through each request type gives up exactly what we need: every request\ntype and every form field per request type.\n\nuserSession()\nThere's another thing left to consider: what if the user isn't currently logged\nin to JIRA? At the very least, we need to check to see if a JIRA session is\nactive:\n\nuser_session_endpoint = 'https://jira.we.co/rest/auth/1/session'\n\ndef getUserSession():\n    \"\"\"Get logged-in user.\"\"\"\n    r = requests.get(user_session_endpoint, headers=headers)\n    if r.status_code == 200:\n        return r.json()\n    else:\n        return False\n\n\nIf the user is logged in to JIRA, we'll receive a 200 code letting us know\neverything is alright. The body of the response will also contain the name of\nthe user plus some extra metadata. What if the user isn't  logged in? Let's get\nto that in a bit.\n\nEasy Routing\nOur view will be nice and simple:\n\nfrom jira import request_forms, user_details\n\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST', 'OPTIONS'])\ndef home():\n    \"\"\"Landing page.\"\"\"\n    if user_details == False:\n        return redirect('https://example.com')\n    else:\n        return render_template('/index.html', requests=request_forms)\n\n\nNotice that all we're doing is making sure the user is signed in to JIRA. But\nwhat's with the example.com, you ask? Well, because I'm leaving this part up to\nyou, dear friend. There's really a number of things we can do, but it depends\nentirely on your situation. For instance:\n\n * You can handle basic auth on your own\n * Register an OAuth application to handle sign-ins (perhaps the most robust\n   solution)\n * If your JIRA instance is behind SSO, you may want to send users to your\n   company's  SAML partner\n * Simply throw an error message\n\nWhatever you decide to do, it's not really my problem. Obligatory smiley face\nemoji :).\n\nThe Template\nRemember: the main reason most of you are probably doing this is to control the\npresentation layer as you see fit. That said, here comes a call of presentation\nlayer text, in the form of a Jinja template:\n\n{% block form %}\n  <div>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Submit new requests here</h3>\n    <ul class=\"collapsible\">\n      {% for request in requests %}\n      <li class=\"{{request.name}}\">\n        <div class=\"collapsible-header\">\n          <img src=\"{{request.icon}}\">\n          <div class=\"info\">\n            <h5>{{request.name}}</h5>\n            <p>{{request.description}}</p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"collapsible-body\">\n          <div class=\"row\">\n            <form method=\"post\">\n              <div>\n                {% for field in request.fields.requestTypeFields %}\n                  {% if field.name in ('Category', 'Product') %}\n                    <div class=\"input-field\">\n                      <select id=\"{{request.name}} {{field.name}}\">\n                        <option value=\"Choose your option\" disabled selected>Choose your option</option>\n                        {% for option in field.validValues %}\n                          <option value=\"{{option.label}}\">{{option.label}}</option>\n                        {% endfor %}\n                      </select>\n                      <label>{{field.name}}</label>\n                    </div>\n                  {% elif field.name == 'Description' %}\n                    <div class=\"input-field\">\n                      <textarea id=\"{{field.name}}\" class=\"materialize-textarea\" placeholder=\"{{field.description}}\"></textarea>\n                      <label for=\"{{request.name}} {{field.name}}\">{{field.name}}</label>\n                    </div>\n                  {% else %}\n                    <div class=\"input-field\">\n                      <input placeholder=\"{{field.description}}\" id=\"{{request.name}} {{field.name}}\" type=\"text\" class=\"validate\">\n                      <label for=\"{{request.name}} {{field.name}}\">{{field.name}}</label>\n                    </div>\n                  {% endif %}\n                {% endfor %}\n                <input type=\"button\" value=\"Submit\" class=\"btn cyan lighten-3 formsubmit\">\n              </div>\n            </form>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      {% endfor %}\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n{% endblock %}\n\n\nBecause we passed the Service Desk JSON we extracted from the JIRA API to our\nform, we can go crazy setting our labels, placeholder text, or whatever,\nanywhere we please. In my example, I utilize Material Design\n[https://materializecss.com/]'s pretty package of pre-made frontend elements,\nbecause God knows nobody wants to deal with designing that shit. Sorry, I was\njust having a brief flashback to Frontend dev.\n\nThe code above explicitly looks for fields we know are dropdowns, so that we may\nfill the select options accordingly. Same goes for textarea fields. That said,\nthe way I've handled this above is, well, stupid. Instead of hardcoding if\nstatements to look for certain fields, leverage our JSON to determine the type\nof each field as you iterate over them. Do as I say, not as I do.\n\nGoing Further\nThere's so much more we can add here. Take a list of the user's opened tickets,\nfor instance. The great thing about controlling your own portal UI is that you\ncan now control the narrative of your own workload: perhaps the person in\nmarketing who started 2 weeks ago could benefit from seeing the 200 tickets\nbeing addressed before her, thus second-guessing the urge to type URGENT across\na subject line only to be violently shoved down your throat.\n\nIn all seriousness, nobody likes the experience of a vanilla helpdesk because it\ndehumanizes the customer. While our personal beliefs reassure us that we are\nspecial, entering a cold support queue is a stark suggestion that we may not be\nso special after all, which isn't exactly a fact Millennials or Executives like\nto ponder on. If nothing else, take this as a chance to build software friendly\ntowards humans with full transparency, and both parties will surely benefit.\nRemember: happy humans bides times for the inevitable robot revolution on the\nhorizon destined to eradicate mankind.

That said, here comes a call of presentation layer text, in the form of a Jinja template:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jinja\">{% block form %}\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;h3 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;&gt;Submit new requests here&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;ul class=&quot;collapsible&quot;&gt;\n      {% for request in requests %}\n      &lt;li class=&quot;{{request.name}}&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;collapsible-header&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;img src=&quot;{{request.icon}}&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;div class=&quot;info&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;h5&gt;{{request.name}}&lt;/h5&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;{{request.description}}&lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;collapsible-body&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;form method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;div&gt;\n                {% for field in request.fields.requestTypeFields %}\n                  {% if field.name in ('Category', 'Product') %}\n                    &lt;div class=&quot;input-field&quot;&gt;\n                      &lt;select id=&quot;{{request.name}} {{field.name}}&quot;&gt;\n                        &lt;option value=&quot;Choose your option&quot; disabled selected&gt;Choose your option&lt;/option&gt;\n                        {% for option in field.validValues %}\n                          &lt;option value=&quot;{{option.label}}&quot;&gt;{{option.label}}&lt;/option&gt;\n                        {% endfor %}\n                      &lt;/select&gt;\n                      &lt;label&gt;{{field.name}}&lt;/label&gt;\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\n                  {% elif field.name == 'Description' %}\n                    &lt;div class=&quot;input-field&quot;&gt;\n                      &lt;textarea id=&quot;{{field.name}}&quot; class=&quot;materialize-textarea&quot; placeholder=&quot;{{field.description}}&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n                      &lt;label for=&quot;{{request.name}} {{field.name}}&quot;&gt;{{field.name}}&lt;/label&gt;\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\n                  {% else %}\n                    &lt;div class=&quot;input-field&quot;&gt;\n                      &lt;input placeholder=&quot;{{field.description}}&quot; id=&quot;{{request.name}} {{field.name}}&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; class=&quot;validate&quot;&gt;\n                      &lt;label for=&quot;{{request.name}} {{field.name}}&quot;&gt;{{field.name}}&lt;/label&gt;\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\n                  {% endif %}\n                {% endfor %}\n                &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot; class=&quot;btn cyan lighten-3 formsubmit&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/form&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      {% endfor %}\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n{% endblock %}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Because we passed the Service Desk JSON we extracted from the JIRA API to our form, we can go crazy setting our labels, placeholder text, or whatever, anywhere we please. In my example, I utilize <a href=\"https://materializecss.com/\">Material Design</a>'s pretty package of pre-made frontend elements, because God knows nobody wants to deal with designing that shit. Sorry, I was just having a brief flashback to Frontend dev.</p><p>The code above explicitly looks for fields we know are dropdowns, so that we may fill the select options accordingly. Same goes for textarea fields. That said, the way I've handled this above is, well, stupid. Instead of hardcoding if statements to look for certain fields, leverage our JSON to determine the type of each field as you iterate over them. Do as I say, not as I do.</p><h2 id=\"going-further\">Going Further</h2><p>There's so much more we can add here. Take a list of the user's opened tickets, for instance. The great thing about controlling your own portal UI is that you can now control the narrative of your own workload: perhaps the person in marketing who started 2 weeks ago could benefit from seeing the 200 tickets being addressed before her, thus second-guessing the urge to type <strong>URGENT </strong>across a subject line only to be violently shoved down your throat.</p><p>In all seriousness, nobody likes the experience of a vanilla helpdesk because it dehumanizes the customer. While our personal beliefs reassure us that we are special, entering a cold support queue is a stark suggestion that we may not be so special after all, which isn't exactly a fact Millennials or Executives like to ponder on. If nothing else, take this as a chance to build software friendly towards humans with full transparency, and both parties will surely benefit. Remember: happy humans bides times for the inevitable robot revolution on the horizon destined to eradicate mankind.
