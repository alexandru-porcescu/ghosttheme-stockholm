In the\npast, we've covered encoding location data from raw addresses\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/preparing-data-for-mapbox-geocoding/], as well\nas an exploration of Mapbox Studio\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/map-data-visualization-with-mapbox/]  for those\ngetting acquainted with the tool. Today we're going a step further: drawing\ndirections on a map.\n\nIt sounds simple enough: we already know how to geocode addresses, so all we\nneed to do is literally go from point A to point B. That said, things always\ntend to get tricky, and if you've never worked with GeoJSON\n[http://geojson.org/]  before, you're in for a treat.\n\nLoad Up Some Data\nI'm going to assume you have a DataFrame ready containing these columns:\n\n * origin_longitude\n * origin_latitude\n * destination_longitude\n * destination_latitude\n * Name/description of this route \n\nIf you want to play along, there are plenty of free datasets out there to play\nwith - I sourced some information from BigQuery while I was testing things out.\n\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nroutes_df = pd.read_csv('datasources/routes.csv').head(10)\ntoken = os.environ.get('mapbox_token')\n\n\nSo far so good- all we've done is load our data, and save our Mapbox token from\nan environment variable.\n\nMapbox Directions Endpoint\nNext, we're going to use Mapbox's Directions API\n[https://docs.mapbox.com/api/navigation/#directions]  to return a route for us.\nThe anatomy of a GET call to receive directions looks like this:\n\nhttps://api.mapbox.com/directions/v5/mapbox/{{method_of_transportation}}/{{origin_longitude}},{{origin_latitude}};{{destination_longitude}},{{destination_latitude}}\n\nPARAMS:\naccess_token={{your_mapbox_access_token}}\ngeometries=geojson\n\n\n * method_of_transportation refers to one of the three methods that Mapbox\n   offers for creating routes: driving-traffic, driving, walking, and cycling.\n   Note that there is currently no way to draw route objects which follow public\n   transit: this is perhaps Mapbox's biggest downfall at the moment.\n   Nevertheless, if this is something you need, data can be imported from Google\n   maps to be used with Mapbox.\n * access_token  can be either your public token (visible upon login at\n   mapbox.com) or a generated secret token.\n * geometries  accepts the method by which to draw the object. This can be \n   GeoJSON,  polyline, or polyline6. Let's stick with GeoJSON.\n\nConstructing API Requests\nLet's construct a request per row in our DataFrame. By using Pandas' apply, we\nfire a function per row to do just that:\n\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nroutes_df = pd.read_csv('datasources/routes.csv').head(10)\ntoken = os.environ.get('mapbox_token')\n\ndef create_route_json(row):\n    \"\"\"Get route JSON.\"\"\"\n    base_url = 'https://api.mapbox.com/directions/v5/mapbox/driving/'\n    url = base_url + str(row['home_longitude']) + \\\n        ',' + str(row['home_latitude']) + \\\n        ';' + str(row['destination_longitude']) + \\\n        ',' + str(row['destination_latitude'])\n    params = {\n        'geometries': 'geojson',\n        'access_token': token\n    }\n    req = requests.get(url, params=params)\n    route_json = req.json()['routes'][0]\n    # Now what?\n\n\nroutes_df.apply(create_route_json, axis=1)\n\n\nHere's where things get a little tricky. You see, GeoJSON abides by a strict\nformat. It looks something like this:\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"Feature\",\n  \"geometry\": {\n    \"coordinates\": [\n      [ -73.985897, 40.748133 ], [ -73.985046, 40.747773 ], \n      [ -73.984579, 40.748431 ], [ -73.973437, 40.743885 ],\n      [ -73.972844, 40.744452 ], [ -73.970728, 40.743885 ], \n      [ -73.970611, 40.735137 ], [ -73.9714, 40.733734 ],\n      [ -73.973503, 40.732341 ], [ -73.969823, 40.729864 ], \n      [ -73.969243, 40.727535 ], [ -73.975074, 40.711418 ],\n      [ -73.976603, 40.710276 ], [ -73.978077, 40.710587 ], \n      [ -73.979462, 40.70932 ], [ -73.992664, 40.708145 ],\n      [ -73.996237, 40.707307 ], [ -74.001135, 40.704086 ], \n      [ -74.0055, 40.70243 ], [ -74.006778, 40.703628 ],\n      [ -74.009173, 40.702484 ], [ -74.010637, 40.70371 ], \n      [ -74.014535, 40.703624 ], [ -74.014665, 40.704034 ],\n      [ -74.017057, 40.703259 ]\n    ],\n    \"type\": \"LineString\"\n  },\n  \"legs\": [{\n      \"summary\": \"\",\n      \"weight\": 3873.3,\n      \"duration\": 3873.3,\n      \"steps\": [],\n      \"distance\": 9660.2\n  }],\n  \"weight_name\": \"duration\",\n  \"weight\": 3873.3,\n  \"duration\": 3873.3,\n  \"distance\": 9660.2,\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"name\": \"Empire State\"\n  }\n}\n\n\nFor the sake of being difficult, the Mapbox Directions API doesn't return\nresponses in exactly this format. Instead, their response looks like this:\n\n{\n  \"routes\": [{\n    \"geometry\": {\n      \"coordinates\": [\n        [-73.985897, 40.748133],\n        [-73.985046, 40.747773],\n        [-73.984579, 40.748431],\n        [-73.973437, 40.743885],\n        [-73.972844, 40.744452],\n        [-73.970728, 40.743885],\n        [-73.970611, 40.735137],\n        [-73.9714, 40.733734],\n        [-73.973503, 40.732341],\n        [-73.969823, 40.729864],\n        [-73.969243, 40.727535],\n        [-73.975074, 40.711418],\n        [-73.976603, 40.710276],\n        [-73.978077, 40.710587],\n        [-73.979462, 40.70932],\n        [-73.992664, 40.708145],\n        [-73.996237, 40.707307],\n        [-74.001135, 40.704086],\n        [-74.0055, 40.70243],\n        [-74.006778, 40.703628],\n        [-74.009173, 40.702484],\n        [-74.010637, 40.70371],\n        [-74.014535, 40.703624],\n        [-74.014665, 40.704034],\n        [-74.017057, 40.703259]\n      ],\n      \"type\": \"LineString\"\n    },\n    \"legs\": [{\n      \"summary\": \"\",\n      \"weight\": 3873.3,\n      \"duration\": 3873.3,\n      \"steps\": [],\n      \"distance\": 9660.2\n    }],\n    \"weight_name\": \"duration\",\n    \"weight\": 3873.3,\n    \"duration\": 3873.3,\n    \"distance\": 9660.2\n  }],\n  \"waypoints\": [{\n      \"distance\": 34.00158252003884,\n      \"name\": \"West 33rd Street\",\n      \"location\": [\n        -73.985897,\n        40.748133\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"distance\": 6.627227256764976,\n      \"name\": \"\",\n      \"location\": [\n        -74.017057,\n        40.703259\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"code\": \"Ok\",\n  \"uuid\": \"cjsomodyl025642o6f1jsddx6\"\n}\n\n\nThe format isn't too  far off, but it's different enough to not work. \n\nFormatting GeoJSON Correctly\nWe need to write a function to take the response Mapbox has given us and\ntransform it into a usable GeoJSON format:\n\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nroutes_df = pd.read_csv('datasources/routes.csv').head(10)\ntoken = os.environ.get('mapbox_token')\n\n\ndef create_route_geojson(route_json, name):\n    \"\"\"Properly formats GeoJson for Mapbox visualization.\"\"\"\n    routes_dict = {\n        \"type\": \"Feature\",\n        \"geometry\": {\n            \"type\": \"LineString\"\n        },\n        \"weight_name\": \"duration\",\n        \"weight\": 718.9,\n        \"duration\": 0,\n        \"distance\": 0,\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"name\": \"\"\n        }\n    }\n    routes_dict['geometry']['coordinates'] = route_json['geometry']['coordinates']\n    routes_dict['legs'] = route_json['legs']\n    routes_dict['duration'] = route_json['legs'][0]['duration']\n    routes_dict['distance'] = route_json['legs'][0]['distance']\n    routes_dict['properties']['name'] = name\n    with open('dataoutput/' + name + '.json', 'w') as f:\n        json.dump(routes_dict, \n                  f, \n                  sort_keys=True, \n                  indent=4, \n                  ensure_ascii=False)\n        \n\ndef create_walking_route(row):\n    \"\"\"Get route JSON.\"\"\"\n    base_url = 'https://api.mapbox.com/directions/v5/mapbox/driving/'\n    url = base_url + str(row['home_longitude']) + \\\n        ',' + str(row['home_latitude']) + \\\n        ';' + str(row['destination_longitude']) + \\\n        ',' + str(row['destination_latitude'])\n    params = {\n        'geometries': 'geojson',\n        'access_token': token\n    }\n    req = requests.get(url, params=params)\n    route_json = req.json()['routes'][0]\n    create_route_geojson(route_json, str(int(row['route_id'])))\n\n\nroutes_df.apply(create_walking_route, axis=1)\n\n\nIt's not pretty, but it's reliable: we explicitly create the JSON structure we\nneed with routes_dict, and modify it with the API responses coming back from\nMapbox. Of course, we're still doing this one at a time, for every row in our\nDataFrame.\n\nYou'll notice I save each JSON file locally for now. In the future, we'll write\na script to automate the process of uploading our GeoJSON objects and adding\nthem to the proper Tilesets, but right now I just want to see that our work paid\noff!\n\nBy using Mapbox studio, we can see the result of our first route:\n\nA \"Driving\" Route from the Empire State Building to Battery Park.Aha! Would you\nlook at that- Mapbox knew to take the FDR drive. That's some promising stuff.\n\nDrawing Routes En Masse\nNaturally, this is only the tip of the iceberg: of the DataFrame of information\nwe loaded up, we've so far only viewed a single result. If anything in data is\nworth doing, it must be done thousands of times systematically without fail.\nLuckily, Mapbox provides us with the tools to do this: from lending us an S3\nbucket, to modifying datasets via the API, there's nothing to fear.\n\nTune in next time when do more... stuff!","html":"<p>If you've been here before, you probably already know our affinity for <strong>Mapbox</strong> and the visualization tools it provides data scientists and analysts.

Over the years Plotly has been\nat the core of some of the most influential products I’ve worked on: a\nhodgepodge of Fintech and humanitarian clients, all of which are still proudly\nwaving their charts and dashboards around the world. Yet, my mind is boggled by\na simple question: what the hell  took us so long to write our first post about\nPlotly? We've been operating Hackers and Slackers for over a full year now...\ndid I seriously write a  post about JQuery\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/making-ajax-calls-with-jquery/]  in that time\nbefore reaching this point?\n\nMuch has changed in the last year or so for our friends in Montreal. Number 1 in\nmy book is the price reduction of their core product: from 300 dollars  to zero.\nI paid the 300 dollars. We really need to get a “donate” button around here. \n\nA close second is undoubtedly the introduction of Plot.ly Dash\n[https://plot.ly/products/dash/]. Dash  tickles a sentiment which has danced\nthrough many young and helplessly naïve Pythonistas' minds: what if we could\nwrite only  in Python, like, forever?  As awful of an idea it is to start\nGoogling Python-to-frontend code interpreters (they exist; I checked), Plotly's\nDash does a shockingly good job of breathing life into that romantic fantasy of\ncommitting to Python forever.\n\nBut we're not here to deliver a recycled 'What is Plotly?'  synopsis. We're not\neven interested in the obligatory 'How to Get Started Using This\nAlready-Well-Documented-Technology' post. Plotly deserves better than that.\nInstead, we're coming hot out of the gate swinging: we're going to show you how\nto beat Plotly down, break it, and make it bend to your will. Welcome to a\nmagical edition of Hacking Plotly. It must be Christmas, folks.\n\nLet's Make a Plotly + Flask Lovechild from Hell\nLike almost every single advancement to come out of Python-geared architecture\nthis year, Dash has a little secret: it's gotten here with a little help from\nFlask. Alright, perhaps more than a little: Dash actually extends Flask. Sounds\nsensible, and perhaps even exciting at first; its almost as though every crush\nyou've ever had decided it be best to simply put their differences aside to\nstart a group chat with you in the interest of making your sexual well-being an\nequal team effort out of sheer love. As you've already guessed, life doesn't\nwork like that.\n\nDash hijacks Flask from the beginning, starting with the way we instantiate the\napp. Any code monkey who has laid eyes upon a wsgi.py file can tell you\nsomething is up before you can even say app = dash.Dash(__name__). Check out the\nrecommended startup boilerplate:\n\nfrom dash import Dash\nimport dash_core_components as dcc\nimport dash_html_components as html\n\nexternal_stylesheets = ['https://codepen.io/fgdsgfhgfh/pen/IHvjvb.css']\n\napp = Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=external_stylesheets)\n\napp.layout = html.Div(\n        id='example-div-element'\n        )\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run_server(debug=True)\n\n\nIf you were to attempt to take this boilerplate and attempt to add core Flask\nlogic, such as authentication with Flask-Login, generating assets with \nFlask-Assets, or just creating a global database, where would you start? Plotly\ncleverly suggests reserving the app  namespace for your app- the very same that\nwe would do with Flask. Yet if we attempt to modify the app  object the same as\nwe would with Flask, nothing will work: Dash has declared an ecosystem, and\nnowhere in that ecosystem are you invited to add custom Flask application logic\nout of the box.\n\nDash does what it was intended to do very well: building dashboard-based\napplications. The issue is that applications which can only display data  aren't\nentirely useful as end products. What if we wanted to create a fully-featured\napp, where data visualization was simply a feature  of said app?\n\nCreating a Fully-Featured App (Where Data Vis is Simply a Feature of Said App)\nA common \"workaround\" you'll find in the community is passing Flask to Dash as\nthe underlying \"server\", something like this:\n\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom dash import Dash\nimport dash_core_components as dcc\nimport dash_html_components as html\n\nserver = Flask(__name__)\napp = dash.Dash(__name__, server=server, url_base_pathname='/path')\napp.layout = html.Div(id='example-div-element')\n\n@server.route(\"/dash\")\ndef MyDashApp():\n    return app.index()\n\n\nMake no mistake: this method sucks. Sure, you've regained the ability to create\nroutes here and there, but let's not forget:\n\n * Your app will always start on a Dash-served page: if anything, we'd want our\n   start page to be something we have full control over to then dive into the\n   Dash components.\n * Access to globally available Flask plugins are still unavailable in this\n   method. Notice how we never set an application context?\n * Your ability to style your application with static assets and styles is\n   completely out of your hands.\n * Container architecture built on Flask, such as Google App Engine, won't play\n   nicely when we start something that isn't Flask. So there's a good chance\n   that playing by the rules means losing the ability to deploy.\n\nIf we want to do these things, we cannot start our app as an instance of Dash\nand attempt to work around it. Instead, we must create a Flask app, and put Dash\nin its place as an app embedded in our  app. This gives us full control over\nwhen users can enter the Dash interface, and even within that interface, we can\nstill manage database connections or user sessions as we see fit. Welcome to the\nbig leagues.\n\nTurning the Tables: Dash Inside Flask\nFirst things first, let's get our wsgi.py  file back. Pretty much any hosted\nPython application expects this, so please: enough with the app.py  nonsense.\n\nfrom plotly_flask_tutorial import create_app\n\napp = create_app()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', debug=True)\n\n\nLook familiar? Not only do we get Flask back, but we get our entire application\nfactory and all that it includes. Take a look at application/__init__.py:\n\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom . import dash_view\n\n\ndef create_app():\n    \"\"\"Construct the core application.\"\"\"\n    app = Flask(__name__, instance_relative_config=False)\n    app.config.from_object('config.Config')\n    dash_app = dash_view.Add_Dash(app)\n\n    with app.app_context():\n        # Construct the core application\n        from . import routes\n        app.register_blueprint(routes.main_bp)\n\n        return app\n\n\nIt's almost as though nothing changed! In fact, the only line we have regarding\nDash here is dash_app = plotly_dash_views.Add_Dash(app). \n\nWe import dash_view  at the start of __init.py__. What is this, you might ask?\nIt's actually a file which contains our Dash app! Dash apps typically like to\nhave a single .py  file per view, which turns out to work great for us. Let's\nlook at why this works by checking dash_view.py:\n\nimport glob\nfrom dash import Dash\nimport dash_table\nimport dash_core_components as dcc\nimport dash_html_components as html\nimport pandas as pd\n\n\ndef Add_Dash(server):\n    \"\"\"Plot.ly Dash view which populates the screen with loaded DataFrames.\"\"\"\n    external_stylesheets = ['https://hackers.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/css/plotly-flask-tutorial.css']\n    dash_app = Dash(server=server,\n                    external_stylesheets=external_stylesheets,\n                    routes_pathname_prefix='/dash_view/')\n\n    # Create Dash Layout\n    dash_app.layout = html.Div(\n        id='dash-container'\n      )\n\n    return dash_app.server\n\n\nWe pass our Flask instance to Add_Dash  as a parameter called server. Unlike the\nprevious examples, it's actually server  running the show this time, with Dash\npiggybacking as a module.

Our application will default to serving\na Flask page, not  a Dash page, so our routes can be an entire standalone\napplication.

Over the years Plotly has been at the core of some of the most influential products I’ve worked on: a hodgepodge of Fintech and humanitarian clients, all of which are still proudly waving their charts and dashboards around the world. Yet, my mind is boggled by a simple question: what the <em>hell</em> took us so long to write our first post about Plotly? We've been operating Hackers and Slackers for over a full year now... did I seriously write a<a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/making-ajax-calls-with-jquery/\"> post about JQuery</a> in that time before reaching this point?</p><p>Much has changed in the last year or so for our friends in Montreal. Number 1 in my book is the price reduction of their core product: from <em><strong>300 dollars</strong></em> to <em><strong>zero</strong></em>. I paid the 300 dollars. We really need to get a “donate” button around here. </p><p>A close second is undoubtedly the introduction of <strong><a href=\"https://plot.ly/products/dash/\">Plot.ly Dash</a></strong>. <strong>Dash</strong> tickles a sentiment which has danced through many young and helplessly naïve Pythonistas' minds: <em>what if we could write </em><strong><em>only</em></strong><em> in Python, like, </em><strong><em>forever</em></strong><em>?</em> As awful of an idea it is to start Googling Python-to-frontend code interpreters (they exist; I checked), Plotly's Dash does a shockingly good job of breathing life into that romantic fantasy of committing to Python forever.</p><p>But we're not here to deliver a recycled 'W<em>hat is Plotly?'</em> synopsis. We're not even interested in the obligatory '<em>How to Get Started Using This Already-Well-Documented-Technology' </em>post<em>. </em>Plotly deserves better than that. Instead, we're coming hot out of the gate swinging: we're going to show you how to beat Plotly down, break it, and make it bend to your will. Welcome to a magical edition of Hacking Plotly. It must be Christmas, folks.</p><h2 id=\"let-s-make-a-plotly-flask-lovechild-from-hell\">Let's Make a Plotly + Flask Lovechild from Hell</h2><p>Like almost every single advancement to come out of Python-geared architecture this year, Dash has a little secret: it's gotten here with a little help from Flask. Alright, perhaps more than a little: Dash actually extends Flask. Sounds sensible, and perhaps even exciting at first; its almost as though every crush you've ever had decided it be best to simply put their differences aside to start a group chat with you in the interest of making your sexual well-being an equal team effort out of sheer love. As you've already guessed, life doesn't work like that.</p><p>Dash hijacks Flask from the beginning, starting with the way we instantiate the app. Any code monkey who has laid eyes upon a <strong>wsgi.py </strong>file can tell you something is up before you can even say <code>app = dash.Dash(__name__)</code>. Check out the recommended startup boilerplate:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-python\">from dash import Dash\nimport dash_core_components as dcc\nimport dash_html_components as html\n\nexternal_stylesheets = ['https://codepen.io/fgdsgfhgfh/pen/IHvjvb.css']\n\napp = Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=external_stylesheets)\n\napp.layout = html.Div(\n        id='example-div-element'\n        )\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run_server(debug=True)\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If you were to attempt to take this boilerplate and attempt to add core Flask logic, such as authentication with <code>Flask-Login</code>, generating assets with <code>Flask-Assets</code>, or just creating a global database, where would you start? Plotly cleverly suggests reserving the <code>app</code> namespace for your app- the very same that we would do with Flask. Yet if we attempt to modify the <code>app</code> object the same as we would with Flask, nothing will work: Dash has declared an ecosystem, and nowhere in that ecosystem are you invited to add custom Flask application logic out of the box.</p><p>Dash does what it was intended to do very well: building dashboard-based applications. The issue is that applications which can <em>only display data</em> aren't entirely useful as end products. What if we wanted to create a fully-featured app, where data visualization was simply a <em>feature</em> of said app?</p><h2 id=\"creating-a-fully-featured-app-where-data-vis-is-simply-a-feature-of-said-app-\">Creating a Fully-Featured App (Where Data Vis is Simply a Feature of Said App)</h2><p>A common \"workaround\" you'll find in the community is passing Flask to Dash as the underlying \"server\", something like this:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Flask\nfrom dash import Dash\nimport dash_core_components as dcc\nimport dash_html_components as html\n\nserver = Flask(__name__)\napp = dash.Dash(__name__, server=server, url_base_pathname='/path')\napp.layout = html.Div(id='example-div-element')\n\n@server.route(&quot;/dash&quot;)\ndef MyDashApp():\n    return app.index()\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Make no mistake: this method <em>sucks. </em>Sure, you've regained the ability to create routes here and there, but let's not forget:</p><ul><li>Your app will always start on a Dash-served page: if anything, we'd want our start page to be something we have full control over to then dive into the Dash components.</li><li>Access to globally available Flask plugins are still unavailable in this method. Notice how we never set an application context?</li><li>Your ability to style your application with static assets and styles is completely out of your hands.</li><li>Container architecture built on Flask, such as Google App Engine, won't play nicely when we start something that isn't Flask. So there's a good chance that playing by the rules means losing the ability to deploy.</li></ul><p>If we want to do these things, we cannot start our app as an instance of Dash and attempt to work around it. Instead, we must create a Flask app, and put Dash in its place as an app embedded in <em>our</em> app. This gives us full control over when users can enter the Dash interface, and even within that interface, we can still manage database connections or user sessions as we see fit.

Chances are if you're pursuing analysis that's\ngroundbreaking (or worthwhile), we're probably starting with some ugly, untapped\ninformation. It turns out Mapbox has an API specifically for this purpose: the \nMapbox Geocoding API [https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#geocoding].\n\nGeocoding  is a blanket term for turning vague information into specific\nLat/Long coordinates. How vague, you ask? The API covers:\n\n * Pinpointing exact location via street address.\n * Locating regions or cities by recognizable name (ie: Rio de Janeiro).\n * Locating cities by highly unspecific name (Geocoding for \"Springfield\" will\n   return results for 41 American cities)\n * Locating cities or venues by name within a given region (such as searching\n   for Ray's Pizza in NYC).\n\nWe can also use Geocoding to do the reverse of this, where passing in\ncoordinates will return location names. If you find this useful, I'm assuming\nyou're a spy.\n\nChipping Away at a Real Use Case\nIn a real-life example, I have two sets of data: one represents general places\nof residence for a particular sample group. The goal is to see how they interact\nwith the second dataset: a list of locations they will be traveling to. I'd love\nto go into more detail, but:\n\nI get one cliche meme per year.So how can we use the Mapbox Geocoding API to\nsystematically extract coordinates for thousands of addresses, from multiple\ndatasets? With Pandas, of course!\n\nI'm Just Happy to be Writing About Pandas Right Now\nPardon my excitement; I've been far overdue for posting anything Pandas-related.\nIt's been killing me on the inside.\n\nWe need to make sense of some vague data. As seen in our Citibike example\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/map-data-visualization-with-mapbox/], New York\nhas plenty of public datasets with information like Taxi pickup/dropoffs, public\ntransit, etc. These start and end points are typically too fluid to have\nLat/Long coordinates associated with them, so we'll add them in ourselves. Given\nthat we're about to pass hundreds or thousands of addresses and locations, we'll\nuse Pandas .apply()  to fill out the missing Lat/Long columns in our dataset. \n\nInstead of using Mapbox's Python SDK, I'll actually be using requests  to hit\nthe Mapbox REST API. For some reason, the Python SDK was a bit unpredictable on\nmy last run.*\n\n*UPDATE: the Python SDK \"wasn't working\" because I apparently don't know the\ndifference between longitude and latitude. Awesome, so I'm a moron.\n\nimport sys\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport requests\nimport json\n\n\nclass GeocodeAddresses:\n    \"\"\"Add missing lat/long information to exisiting dataset.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, address_data):\n        self.data = address_data\n        self.address_df = pd.read_csv(self.data)\n        self.complete_data = self.get_coords(self.address_df)\n\n\n    @classmethod\n    def get_coords(self, employee_address_df):\n        \"\"\"Fill Dataframe lat/long columns.\"\"\"\n\n        def fill_coords(row):\n            \"\"\"Create a route object by passing GeoJSON start/end objects.\"\"\"\n            base_url = 'https://api.mapbox.com/geocoding/v5/mapbox.places/'\n            address = str(row.home_address)\n            format = '.json'\n            endpoint = base_url + address + format\n            params = {\n                'access_token':  'pk.eyJ1IjNoYXJkd2VthisisreallolaXdyNHQ3OTUifQ.VTAUrmzD91Ppxr1AJww'\n            }\n            headers = {\n                'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n            }\n            r = requests.get(endpoint, params=params, headers=headers)\n            try:\n                Lat = r.json()['features'][0]['geometry']['coordinates'][0]\n                Long = r.json()['features'][0]['geometry']['coordinates'][1]\n                print(pd.Series([Lat, Long]))\n                return pd.Series([Lat, Long])\n            except IndexError:\n                pass\n\n        address_df[['Lat', 'Long']] = address_df.head(100).apply(fill_coords, axis=1)\n        address_df.to_csv('geocoded.csv')\n\n\nIn the above example, we're using .apply()  against an empty series (our\nLat/Long columns) as opposed to our entire Dataframe. When get_coords()  returns\ntwo values, these values will fill the empty columns on a per-row basis.\n\nFor the scope of this tutorial, we'll simply focus on getting these points\nplotted. Don't worry, this is only part 2 of our Mapbox series! Yes, an entire\nseries!\n\nTurning Your Datasets into Tilesets\nIn Mapbox terms, a Tileset  is essentially a layer of data we can overlay on top\nof our blank map. The map style  we created last time was really just the\naesthetic unpinning of all the interesting data we can pile on time.\n\nTilesets can be stacked on one another, thus giving us infinite possibilities of\nthe types of data we can communicate: especially when you consider that Mapbox\nsupports Heatmaps and topology - far more than just plotted points.\n\nFirst, we'll plot our origins. I've put together a dataset of completely\nfalsified names (with presumably real addresses?) to demonstrate how we'd plot\nthese points.

Using Mapbox Studio\n[https://www.mapbox.com/studio/datasets/], we can upload our data and turn it\ninto a tileset; the heart and soul of what makes our maps interesting. \n\nOnce you've uploaded your CSV (or JSON, or whatever) as a dataset, we can\nimmediately see what this information looks like on a map by previewing it as a\ntileset. Mapbox is surprisingly intelligent in that it can deduce lat/long\nvalues from poorly named or formatted columns (such as Lat/Long, \nLatitutde/Longitude, start_longitude_lol/start_latitude_lmao, etc). Mapbox gets\nit right most of the time.\n\nIf y'all went well you should see a cluster of points on a map - this is a\npreview of your Tileset. Think of this as a layer in Photoshop: we can stack\nthese layers of information atop one another continuously to make something\ngreater than the sum of its parts.\n\nIf all looks good, export your Tileset via the \"export\" button on the top right.\n\nUpload your dataset and click \"edit\"Switch Over to Your Map \"Style\"\nYou map 'style' is your blank canvas. Get in there and add a layer, and from\nthere select the Tileset you just created. Once your Tileset is loaded, you can\nstyle the points themselves and even label them with the data in your dataset as\nyou see fit:\n\nSo many colorful layers.Simply clicking around the preloaded Tilesets should\nstart giving you ideas of what's possible down the line. Just look at those\nhorrifically bright Miami Vice themed streets.\n\nFeel free to get creative with Mapbox's tools to clarify the visual story you're\ntrying to tell. I've distinguished points from others after adding a third data\nset: Every Starbucks in New York City.  Yes, those map pins have been replaced\nwith that terrifying Starbucks Logo Mermaid Sea-demon\n\nTake a look at that perfect grid of mocha frappa-whatevers and tell me these\nguys don't have a business strategy:\n\nGod that's an ugly map.For all it's worth, I'd like to sincerely apologize for\nblinding your eyes with classless use of gifs paired with the useless corporate\nmonstrosity of a map I've created. I have faith that you'll do better.\n\nNow that we've spent enough time covering the n00b stuff, it's time to take the\ngloves off. While Mapbox studio's GUI serves as an amazing crutch and way to\ncustomize the look of our data, we must not forget: we're programmers, God damn\nit! True magic lies in 1s and 0s, not WYSIWYG editors.\n\nUntil we start using Plot.ly Dash, that is.\n\n(Suddenly, thousands of fans erupt into a roaring cheer at the very mention of\nPlot.ly.

Mapbox is surprisingly intelligent in that it can deduce lat/long values from poorly named or formatted columns (such as <em>Lat/Long</em>, <em>Latitutde/Longitude</em>, <em>start_longitude_lol/start_latitude_lmao</em>, etc). Mapbox gets it right most of the time.</p><p>If y'all went well you should see a cluster of points on a map - this is a preview of your Tileset.

In fact, I can hardly\nremember a product where this hadn't  become the case. One can hardly blame the\nsearch engine; after all, our tendency to ignore the Terms and Service\nagreements (as well as payment policies) has always been core to the Google\nbusiness model.  Even then, there are enough enterprises to go around to turn a\nblind eye and actually pay such a bill willingly without exploring alternatives.\n\nData Scientists in particular have no excuse for inaction when it comes to\nseeking a better alternative. As it turns out, there is  one, and it is Cheaper,\n Easier, and perhaps more Fully Featured  than its Google Maps counterpart. That\nproduct is Mapbox. \n\nMapbox  is much more than a Google API clone. The web product offers a plethora\nof UI-driven features that we can use to customize maps as well as save or\neffortlessly transform raw data into workable GeoJSON data without even touching\nan API (which, mind you, there is.... with SDKs in every conceivable language).\nWe're going to create a quick map visualization incorporating some real data to\nget introduced to Mapbox's functionality, but this is only the beginning.\nDownload the line we'll see just how easy it is to incorporate Mapbox in\nproducts like Plot.ly Dash  or even Jupyter Notebooks.\n\nX Marks the Spot\nBefore straying from reigning champion Google Maps, it's worth exploring the\nsignificance of the metric that brought us here first: price.\n\nMurphy's law clearly states \"Cash Rules Everything Around Me, C.R.E.A.M; get the\nmoney, Dolla dolla bill y'all.\"  Given this reality, a minimum requirement for\nMapbox should be it's pricing model when compared to Google's.\n\nMapbox Pricing Tiers\nPrice\n Web apps\n Mobile SDKs\n Free to Start\n\n$0\n\n50,000  map views /mo\n\n50,000  Geocoding requests /mo\n\n50,000  Directions requests /mo\n\n50,000  Matrix elements /mo\n\n50,000  Tilequery requests /mo\n\n50,000  map views /mo\n\n50,000  Geocoding requests /mo\n\n50,000  Directions requests /mo\n\n50,000  Matrix elements /mo\n\n50,000  Tilequery requests /mo\n\nAdditional Usage\n\n$0.50\n\n50,000  map views /mo\n\n50,000  Geocoding requests /mo\n\n50,000  Directions requests /mo\n\n50,000  Matrix elements /mo\n\n50,000  Tilequery requests /mo\n\n50,000  map views /mo\n\n50,000  Geocoding requests /mo\n\n50,000  Directions requests /mo\n\n50,000  Matrix elements /mo\n\n50,000  Tilequery requests /mo\n\nCompare this to Google's transparent pricing structure:\n\nGoogle API Pricing Tiers\nPrice\n Web apps\n Mobile SDKs\n Starter Pack\n\nBrown Paper Bag full of $20s\n\n5  and a half map views /mo\n\n11  times thinking about the API /mo\n\n6  verbal mentions of \"Google\" /mo\n\n2  directions to shitty parties /mo\n\n8  visits to anywhere /mo\n\n9  Android unlocks /mo\n\n12  Google queries for restaurants /mo\n\n3  \"OK Google\" queries /mo\n\n7  Accidental app opens /mo\n\n1  Creating the next \"Uber for X\" /mo\n\nAdditional Usage\n\nEleventy Billion Dollars\n\nUnlimited Requests!* \n\n*See Pricing \n\nUnlimited Requests!*\n\n*See Pricing\n\nSeems like a convincing point in the win column for Mapbox. If we stay within\nreason, Mapbox can essentially serve us as an entirely free service.\n\nSurely we must be missing something  since we're opting for free services\nthough, right? How do Mapbox visualizations stack up against Google Maps?\n\n\n[https://codepen.io/ro-ka/pen/ENoOjz/]  [https://codepen.io/ro-ka] \n[https://codepen.io]\n\nPardon my French here, but hot damn that map is dope.  There are plenty more\nexamples where that came from, but it's clear that Mapbox has lowkey stolen the\nhearts of the scientific analysis  market, while Google  concerns itself on the \nconsumer  and business  markets.\n\nTonight's Itinerary: Creating Dope Maps\nTo make some data art, we have a few items on our checklist:\n\n * Obtain a dataset with location-based data: In our case of routing, we need a\n   dataset with a set origin and destination per row.\n * Create direction object routes by running our dataset through the Mapbox API.\n    \n * Create a styled map for our presentation by using Mapbox's style editor.\n * Overlay our route data on our beautiful map.\n\nStep 1: Get Some Free Data\nNow that we've properly shit-talked Google, let's use Google. We're going to\nneed to get some good data, and BigQuery  has some awesome free datasets that we\ncan run wild with. I'll be opting for NYC's dataset on Citibike trips, as it\nprovides a clean set of data where starting and ending coordinates are always\npresent.\n\nGoogle Cloud's Free Dataset of Citibike TripsAs a side note, BigQuery is great.\nEven if you're only somewhat versed in SQL, BigQuery's syntax is essentially\nwhatever your first guess would be.\n\nGranted we only need the start and end locations to make our map, but i decided\nto take a bit extra for curiosity's sake:\n\nstart_namestart_latitudestart_longitudeend_nameend_latitudeend_longitude1 Ave &\nE 15 St40.732218530-73.9816555701 Ave & E 18 St40.733812192-73.9805442091 Ave &\nE 30 St40.741443870-73.975360820E 39 St & 2 Ave40.747803730-73.9734419001 Ave &\nE 62 St40.761227400-73.960940220E 75 St & 3 Ave40.771129270-73.9577229702 Ave &\nE 99 St40.786258600-73.9455257903 Ave & E 112 St40.795508000-73.9416060003 St &\n3 Ave40.675070500-73.98775226010 St & 7 Ave40.666207800-73.9819988603 St &\nProspect Park West40.668132000-73.9736383103 St & Prospect Park West40.668132000\n-73.9736383106 Ave & W 33 St40.749012710-73.988483950W 37 St & 5 Ave40.750380090\n-73.9833898808 Ave & W 52 St40.763707390-73.985161500Central Park S & 6 Ave\n40.765909360-73.97634151011 Ave & W 41 St40.760300960-73.998842220W 34 St & 11\nAve40.755941590-74.00211630012 Ave & W 40 St40.760875020-74.002776680W 42 St & 8\nAve40.757569900-73.990985070Allen St & E Houston St40.722055000-73.989111000Mott\nSt & Prince St40.723179580-73.994800120Allen St & Hester St40.716058660\n-73.991907590Greenwich St & N Moore St40.720434110-74.010206090Amsterdam Ave & W\n73 St40.779668090-73.980930448E 85 St & 3 Ave40.778012030-73.954071490Bank St &\nHudson St40.736528890-74.006180260MacDougal St & Prince St40.727102580\n-74.002970880Bank St & Washington St40.736196700-74.008592070W 4 St & 7 Ave S\n40.734011430-74.002938770Barclay St & Church St40.712912240-74.010202340Clinton\nSt & Tillary St40.696192000-73.991218000Berkeley Pl & 7 Ave40.675146839\n-73.975232095West Drive & Prospect Park West40.661063372-73.979452550Bialystoker\nPl & Delancey St40.716226440-73.982612060Reade St & Broadway40.714504510\n-74.005627890Broadway & W 24 St40.742354300-73.989150760South End Ave & Liberty\nSt40.711512000-74.015756000Broadway & W 29 St40.746200900-73.988557230Stanton St\n& Chrystie St40.722293460-73.991475350Broadway & W 56 St40.765265400\n-73.981923380Broadway & W 49 St40.760683271-73.984527290Broadway & W 58 St\n40.766953170-73.9816933305 Ave & E 78 St40.776321422-73.964273930Cadman Plaza E\n& Red Cross Pl40.699917550-73.989717730Leonard St & Church St40.717571000\n-74.005549000Cadman Plaza E & Tillary St40.695976830-73.990148920Lawrence St &\nWilloughby St40.692361780-73.986317460Carmine St & 6 Ave40.730385990\n-74.002149880W 27 St & 7 Ave40.746647000-73.993915000Central Park W & W 96 St\n40.791270000-73.964839000W 52 St & 6 Ave40.761329831-73.979820013Central Park\nWest & W 76 St40.778967840-73.973747370Central Park S & 6 Ave40.765909360\n-73.976341510Step 2: Style a Sexy Map in Mapbox Studio\nMapbox provides a superb web UI labeled “studio” interface to help us get\nstarted. The “studio” web UI is separated into three parts: custom map styles, \ntilesets, and datasets.\n\nAll of these can we saved for later use.These three sections can be summarized\nas:\n\n * Styles: Custom map styles editable via a GUI, which produce a stylesheet for\n   convenience \n * Tilesets: Map overlays we can apply from our own data or otherwise to segment\n   geographical areas\n * Datasets:  Data containing anything from points on a map to complex direction\n   routes we can overlay atop our map.\n\nHere's a quick look at the Map style editor:\n\nI want to wake up, in a city that doesn't sleep.Save your styled map once you\nfind it to be adequately attractive. We'll need it for later.\n\nStep 4: Start a Flask App\nOf course we're making a Flask app; is there even any other kind? We'll be using\nthe Flask Application Factory setup as we usually do, so we should end up with a\nfile structure as below. If you feel like you're getting ahead of ourself,\ncheckout our post on structuring Flask applications\n[https://hackersandslackers.com/structuring-your-flask-app/].\n\nmapbox-app\n├── /application\n│   └── __init__.py\n├── /datasets\n│   ├── data.json\n│   └── output.csv   \n├── /maps\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── /templates\n│   │    └── index.html\n│   ├── views.py\n│   └── plots.py\n├── start.sh\n├── settings.py\n├── wsgi.py\n├── Pipfile\n├── README.md\n└── requirements.txt\n\n\nTo mix things up a bit we'll use a shell script this time to handle envars and\nrunning our script. Start by creating start.sh:\n\n# start.sh\n\nexport FLASK_APP=wsgi.py\nexport FLASK_DEBUG=1\nexport APP_CONFIG_FILE=settings.py\nflask run\n\n\nYes, we'll be using settings.py  as our config file for a change. Ahhh, just\nlike the Django days. This file should contain a Mapbox access token. Mapbox\nprovides you with a public token by default in many of its tutorials (noted by\nthe pk  prefix for 'public key' - contrast this with sk  for 'secret key'). If\nyou'd like to do anything meaningful with Mapbox, you'll have to retrieve a\nsecret key via the UI. Then we can add this token to settings.py  as such:\n\nMAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=\"sk.eyJ1IB&F^&f^R&DFRUYFTRUctyrcTYRUFrtCFTYDYTuEg\"\n\n\nFinally, here's a look at application/__init__.py  just to make sure we're on\nthe same page:\n\n# application/__init__.py\n\nimport os\nfrom flask import Flask, g\n\ndef create_app():\n    \"\"\"Construct the core application.\"\"\"\n    app = Flask(__name__)\n    app.config.from_envvar('APP_CONFIG_FILE', silent=True)\n\n    with app.app_context():\n        # Construct map blueprint\n        from maps import mapviews\n        app.register_blueprint(mapviews.map_blueprint)\n\n        return app\n\n\nStep 5: Create a Blueprint for Your Map\nYou may have noticed we registered this Blueprint in the previous step. Create a\n /maps  directory which we'll set as a module; we'll need this to handle the \nview, model (or just data),  and controller (routes.py as seen below).\n\nroutes.py\nimport os\nfrom flask import Blueprint, render_template, request\nfrom flask import current_app as app\nfrom . import locations\n\nmap_blueprint = Blueprint('map', __name__, template_folder='templates', static_folder='static')\nplot_locations = locations.LocationData()\n\n\n# Landing Page\n@map_blueprint.route('/', methods=['GET'])\ndef map():\n    return render_template('index.html', ACCESS_KEY=app.MAPBOX_ACCESS_KEY,  locations=plot_locations.get_plots, title=\"CitiBike Mapbox App.\")\n\n\n\ntemplates/index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset='utf-8' />\n  <title>{{title}}</title>\n  <meta name='viewport' content='initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no' />\n  <script src='https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v0.49.0/mapbox-gl.js'></script>\n  <link href='https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v0.49.0/mapbox-gl.css' rel='stylesheet' />\n  <style>\n    body { margin:0; padding:0; }\n    #map { position:absolute; top:0; bottom:0; width:100%; }\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div id='map'></div>\n<script>\nmapboxgl.accessToken = {{MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN}};\nconst map = new mapboxgl.Map({\n  container: 'map',\n  style: 'mapbox://styles/toddbirchard/cjpij1gfhghiy2spetf5w998w',\n  center: [-73.981856, 40.703820],\n  zoom: 11.1,\n\n});\n\nmap.on('load', function(e) {\n  // Add the data to your map as a layer\n  map.addLayer({\n    id: 'locations',\n    type: 'symbol',\n    // Add a GeoJSON source containing place coordinates and information.\n    source: {\n      type: 'geojson',\n      data: {{locations}}\n    },\n    layout: {\n      'icon-image': 'restaurant-15',\n      'icon-allow-overlap': true,\n    }\n  });\n});\n</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\ndata.py\nNormally this is where we'd use the magic of the Mapbox API to get coordinates,\nroute objects, or whatever it is your heart hopes to plot. This is intended to\nbe intro post, so let's break that logic out for another time and use a dataset\nMapbox would be happy to receive for the sake of results.\n\nStep 6: Uploading our Dataset via Mapbox Studio\nMapbox graciously lets us upload our data via their Studio UI, which does the\nunthinkable; immediately upon upload, Mapbox will take the data we give it\n(whether it be CSV, GeoJSON, etc) and immediately parse it in a way that makes\nsense. Upload your dataset at https://www.mapbox.com/studio/datasets/:\n\nUploading the raw data of our Citibike CSV.Next, Mapbox shows us a preview of\nour data before we even know what happened:\n\nIt's like they don't even want us to do work.Step 7: Do It in Flask\nAfter uploading your dataset via mapbox studio, you can actually redownload  the\ndata with a subtle twist: your data will be automatically formatted as GeoJSON:\nthe format of JSON objects Mapbox uses to plot points, draw routes, etc.\n\nSince we've had a long day, I'll allow you to download this pre-formatted data\nand hardcore the values in to your Map view. You're getting off easy for now,\nbut next time we're doing this programmatically ;).\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n\n<head>\n  <meta charset='utf-8' />\n  <title>{{title}}</title>\n  <meta name='viewport' content='initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no' />\n  <script src='https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v0.49.0/mapbox-gl.js'></script>\n  <link href='https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v0.49.0/mapbox-gl.css' rel='stylesheet' />\n  <style>\n    body {\n      margin: 0;\n      padding: 0;\n    }\n\n    #map {\n      position: absolute;\n      top: 0;\n      bottom: 0;\n      width: 100%;\n    }\n  </style>\n</head>\n\n<body>\n\n  <div id='map'></div>\n  <script>\n    mapboxgl.accessToken = '{{ACCESS_KEY}}';\n    const map = new mapboxgl.Map({\n      container: 'map',\n      style: 'mapbox://styles/toddbirchard/cjpij1oxl3hiy2spetf5w998w',\n      center: [-73.981856, 40.703820],\n      zoom: 11.1,\n\n    });\n\n\n    map.addLayer({\n      \"id\": \"points\",\n      \"type\": \"symbol\",\n      \"source\": {\n        \"features\": [{\n            \"type\": \"Feature\",\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"start_station_name\": \"Central Park West & W 76 St\",\n              \"end_station_name\": \"Central Park S & 6 Ave\",\n              \"end_station_latitude\": \"40.76590936\",\n              \"end_station_longitude\": \"-73.97634151\"\n            },\n            \"geometry\": {\n              \"coordinates\": [\n                -73.973747,\n                40.778967\n              ],\n              \"type\": \"Point\"\n            },\n            \"id\": \"000a1f944d4dd786d9e7ed04620af02b\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"Feature\",\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"start_station_name\": \"W 64 St & West End Ave\",\n              \"end_station_name\": \"W 70 St & Amsterdam Ave\",\n              \"end_station_latitude\": \"40.77748046\",\n              \"end_station_longitude\": \"-73.98288594\"\n            },\n            \"geometry\": {\n              \"coordinates\": [\n                -73.987537,\n                40.774528\n              ],\n              \"type\": \"Point\"\n            },\n            \"id\": \"01d8c19524f067a3f4712653265e0a49\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"Feature\",\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"start_station_name\": \"E 20 St & FDR Drive\",\n              \"end_station_name\": \"W 13 St & 7 Ave\",\n              \"end_station_latitude\": \"40.73781509\",\n              \"end_station_longitude\": \"-73.99994661\"\n            },\n            \"geometry\": {\n              \"coordinates\": [\n                -73.975738,\n                40.733142\n              ],\n              \"type\": \"Point\"\n            },\n            \"id\": \"038ac5403b136e34874a7278f64d4e95\"\n          },\n          {\n              \\\\ --------------------------------------\n              (etc etc....)\n               \\\\ --------------------------------------\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"Feature\",\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"start_station_name\": \"Mercer St & Bleecker St\",\n              \"end_station_name\": \"1 Ave & E 30 St\",\n              \"end_station_latitude\": \"40.74144387\",\n              \"end_station_longitude\": \"-73.97536082\"\n            },\n            \"geometry\": {\n              \"coordinates\": [\n                -73.996621,\n                40.727063\n              ],\n              \"type\": \"Point\"\n            },\n            \"id\": \"ff1daf9aadbf0cd6b788bd76f0a3f333\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\"\n      },\n      \"layout\": {\n        \"icon-image\": \"{icon}-15\",\n        \"text-field\": \"{title}\",\n        \"text-font\": [\"Open Sans Semibold\", \"Arial Unicode MS Bold\"],\n        \"text-offset\": [0, 0.6],\n        \"text-anchor\": \"top\"\n      }\n    });\n  </script>\n\n</body>\n\n</html>\n\n\nUncharted Territory\nThere's way more for us to explore in Mapbox.

We'll be using the Flask Application Factory setup as we usually do, so we should end up with a file structure as below. If you feel like you're getting ahead of ourself, checkout our post on <a href=\"https://hackersandslackers.com/structuring-your-flask-app/\">structuring Flask applications</a>.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mapbox-app\n├── /application\n│   └── __init__.py\n├── /datasets\n│   ├── data.json\n│   └── output.csv   \n├── /maps\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── /templates\n│   │    └── index.html\n│   ├── views.py\n│   └── plots.py\n├── start.sh\n├── settings.py\n├── wsgi.py\n├── Pipfile\n├── README.md\n└── requirements.txt\n</code></pre>\n<p>To mix things up a bit we'll use a shell script this time to handle envars and running our script. Start by creating <strong>start.sh</strong>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># start.sh\n\nexport FLASK_APP=wsgi.py\nexport FLASK_DEBUG=1\nexport APP_CONFIG_FILE=settings.py\nflask run\n</code></pre>\n<p>Yes, we'll be using <code>settings.py</code> as our config file for a change. Ahhh, just like the Django days. This file should contain a Mapbox <strong>access token</strong>. Mapbox provides you with a public token by default in many of its tutorials (noted by the <em><strong>pk</strong> </em>prefix for <em>'public key' - </em>contrast this with <strong><em>sk</em></strong> for <em>'secret key'</em>). If you'd like to do anything meaningful with Mapbox, you'll have to retrieve a secret key via the UI. Then we can add this token to <code>settings.py</code> as such:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=&quot;sk.eyJ1IB&amp;F^&amp;f^R&amp;DFRUYFTRUctyrcTYRUFrtCFTYDYTuEg&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, here's a look at <code>application/__init__.py</code> just to make sure we're on the same page:</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\"># application/__init__.py\n\nimport os\nfrom flask import Flask, g\n\ndef create_app():\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;Construct the core application.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n    app = Flask(__name__)\n    app.config.from_envvar('APP_CONFIG_FILE', silent=True)\n\n    with app.app_context():\n        # Construct map blueprint\n        from maps import mapviews\n        app.register_blueprint(mapviews.map_blueprint)\n\n        return app\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"step-5-create-a-blueprint-for-your-map\">Step 5: Create a Blueprint for Your Map</h2><p>You may have noticed we registered this Blueprint in the previous step. Create a <code>/maps</code> directory which we'll set as a module; we'll need this to handle the <strong>view</strong>, <strong>model </strong>(or just data),  and <strong>controller </strong>(routes.py as seen below).</p><h3 id=\"routes-py\">routes.py</h3><pre><code class=\"language-python\">import os\nfrom flask import Blueprint, render_template, request\nfrom flask import current_app as app\nfrom . import locations\n\nmap_blueprint = Blueprint('map', __name__, template_folder='templates', static_folder='static')\nplot_locations = locations.LocationData()\n\n\n# Landing Page\n@map_blueprint.route('/', methods=['GET'])\ndef map():\n    return render_template('index.html', ACCESS_KEY=app.MAPBOX_ACCESS_KEY,  locations=plot_locations.get_plots, title=&quot;CitiBike Mapbox App.&quot;)\n\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"templates-index-html\">templates/index.html</h3><pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;meta charset='utf-8' /&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;{{title}}&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;meta name='viewport' content='initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no' /&gt;\n  &lt;script src='https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v0.49.0/mapbox-gl.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;link href='https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v0.49.0/mapbox-gl.css' rel='stylesheet' /&gt;\n  &lt;style&gt;\n    body { margin:0; padding:0; }\n    #map { position:absolute; top:0; bottom:0; width:100%; }\n  &lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n\n&lt;div id='map'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\nmapboxgl.accessToken = {{MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN}};\nconst map = new mapboxgl.Map({\n  container: 'map',\n  style: 'mapbox://styles/toddbirchard/cjpij1gfhghiy2spetf5w998w',\n  center: [-73.981856, 40.703820],\n  zoom: 11.1,\n\n});\n\nmap.on('load', function(e) {\n  // Add the data to your map as a layer\n  map.addLayer({\n    id: 'locations',\n    type: 'symbol',\n    // Add a GeoJSON source containing place coordinates and information.\n    source: {\n      type: 'geojson',\n      data: {{locations}}\n    },\n    layout: {\n      'icon-image': 'restaurant-15',\n      'icon-allow-overlap': true,\n    }\n  });\n});\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"data-py\">data.py</h3><p>Normally this is where we'd use the magic of the Mapbox API to get coordinates, route objects, or whatever it is your heart hopes to plot. This is intended to be intro post, so let's break that logic out for another time and use a dataset Mapbox would be happy to receive for the sake of results.</p><h2 id=\"step-6-uploading-our-dataset-via-mapbox-studio\">Step 6: Uploading our Dataset via Mapbox Studio</h2><p>Mapbox graciously lets us upload our data via their Studio UI, which does the unthinkable; immediately upon upload, Mapbox will take the data we give it (whether it be CSV, GeoJSON, etc) and immediately parse it in a way that makes sense. Upload your dataset at <a href=\"https://www.mapbox.com/studio/datasets/\">https://www.mapbox.com/studio/datasets/</a>:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/q_auto:good/v1/images/Screen-Shot-2018-12-10-at-5.29.24-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Uploading the raw data of our Citibike CSV.</figcaption></figure><p>Next, Mapbox shows us a preview of our data before we even know what happened:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/hackers-and-slackers/image/upload/q_auto:good/v1/images/Screen-Shot-2018-12-10-at-5.28.24-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>It's like they don't even want us to do work.</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"step-7-do-it-in-flask\">Step 7: Do It in Flask</h2><p>After uploading your dataset via mapbox studio, you can actually <em>redownload</em> the data with a subtle twist: your data will be automatically formatted as GeoJSON: the format of JSON objects Mapbox uses to plot points, draw routes, etc.</p><p>Since we've had a long day, I'll allow you to download this pre-formatted data and hardcore the values in to your Map view.
